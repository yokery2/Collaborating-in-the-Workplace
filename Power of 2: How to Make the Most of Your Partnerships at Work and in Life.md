Many of the greatest accomplishments can be reached only by two people working together. Tenzing and Hillary were the first to scale Mt. Everest. Malone and Stockton were the key to each other’s success on the basketball court. Eisner was never as effective at Disney without Wells.
> 许多最伟大的成就只有两个人共同努力才能实现。丹增与希拉里是第一个登顶珠穆朗玛峰的人。马隆与斯托克顿在篮球场上互为成功的关键。艾斯纳在没有威尔斯的情况下从未像与他合作时那样在迪士尼发挥出色。

But while some partnerships reach great heights, others fall short. Why do some people click while others clash? What do great pairs have in common? And what can you learn from the most powerful partnerships to strengthen collaboration in your work and personal life?
> 但有些伙伴关系能攀登至高峰，而另一些则未能如愿。为什么有些人能合拍而有些人却冲突不断？优秀的搭档有哪些共同点？从最强有力的伙伴关系中你能学到什么，来增强你在工作和个人生活中的协作？

Based on Gallup’s groundbreaking research, Power of 2 details the eight elements that prepare partners to succeed in their most important endeavors. Rodd Wagner, coauthor of the bestseller 12: The Elements of Great Managing, and Gallup World Poll leader Dr. Gale Muller share the science and the secrets of successful collaboration.

Made for Collaborating

> 为协作而生

> 灭是

Face it. Your partnerships could use some help.
> 说实话。你的合作关系需要一些帮助。

If you are like most people, you’ve had some good ones. You may even have a few of them now. Yet chances are you don’t make the most of the collaborative opportunities all around you. You are surrounded by potential partners: colleagues, neighbors, friends, fellow volunteers. You know many people, and they know you. But powerful partnerships - the kind in which you and a collaborator regularly work together, reach goals together you never could have accomplished apart, and gain the deep satisfaction only such an alliance can bring - are elusive.
> 如果你和大多数人一样，你也曾有过一些美好的合作。或许你现在还有几个。然而，很可能你并没有充分利用身边的协作机会。你周围充满潜在的合作者：同事、邻居、朋友、志愿者同伴。你认识很多人，他们也认识你。但强有力的伙伴关系——那种你和合作者定期携手合作、共同实现单独无法完成的目标，并获得只有这种联盟才能带来的深切满足感——却难以捉摸。

You almost certainly spend much of your time working on projects for which you alone are responsible, feeling the full pressure of having to do the whole thing yourself, even the aspects that are not your strength. And when, somehow, you struggle through and complete the job, you turn it in, perhaps get a little recognition from your boss, and move on to the next requirement, which you will also do largely by yourself.
> 你几乎可以肯定会花大量时间独自承担项目，感受到不得不亲自完成全部工作的全部压力，即便那些并非你的强项。当你不知怎的艰难完成任务并交付时，或许会从上司那里得到一些认可，然后继续下一个你也将主要独自完成的任务。

POWER OF 2

> 力量的二人组

You are not alone in having this problem. Somewhere we got off track. Somehow our televisions, e-mail, headphones, cell phones, car radios, and personal computers trick our brains into thinking we are with other people, interacting, when we are, in fact, working in isolation. We are crowded in offices, airports, subways - frequently within arm’s reach of dozens of people - but often on a very lonely pursuit. Wired? Yes. Networked? Yes. Collaborating? Not much.
> 你并不是唯一有这个问题的人。不知何时我们走偏了路。不知怎的，我们的电视、电子邮件、耳机、手机、汽车收音机和个人电脑欺骗了大脑，让我们以为自己正与他人互动，实际上却是在独自工作。我们挤在办公室、机场、地铁里——经常与数十人近在咫尺——但常常进行的是一种非常孤独的活动。连线？是的。联网？是的。协作？并不多。

Humans are made for collaborating. We like music because the songs of our deepest ancestors helped them work together. Our blood pressure rises and falls depending on who is nearby. The amount we eat depends a lot on the amount eaten by those with whom we dine. We laugh, not so much because something is funny, but because laughter is a kind of social glue; a person is 30 times more likely to laugh when he’s with somebody than when he is alone.
> 人类天生适合协作。我们喜欢音乐，因为迄今为止最深远祖先的歌声帮助他们协同工作。我们的血压会随着周围人的存在而升降。我们的食量在很大程度上取决于与我们同席者的食量。我们笑，不完全因为某事好笑，而因为笑声是一种社交黏合剂；一个人在有人陪伴时比独处时更有可能笑，概率高出 30 倍。

When you watch someone, a network of “mirror neurons” in your brain rehearses what he is doing, giving you the ability to see things from his perspective. If one person in a conversation uses a certain word - calls an object’s color turquoise, for example - the other person will probably use the same word rather than a synonym such as teal. We unconsciously adjust our grammar and word choices to match what the other person already said. It’s a subconscious way of signaling “I agree with you.” This mimicry, one study found, “is automatic and reflects the fact that humans are designed for dialogue rather than monologue.”
> 当你观察某人时，大脑中的一组“镜像神经元”会演练他正在做的事情，从而让你能够从他的角度看问题。如果对话中的一个人使用了某个词——例如把一个物体的颜色称为青绿色——另一个人很可能会使用相同的词，而不是使用诸如翠绿色之类的同义词。我们会在无意识中调整语法和用词，以匹配对方已经说过的话。这是一种下意识的方式，表示“我同意你”。一项研究发现，这种模仿“是自动的，反映出人类注定是为对话而非独白而设计的。”

Having a collaborator changes our perception of reality. Volunteers in one experiment were asked to estimate the weight of a basket of potatoes before they touched it. Those who were told they would have help lifting the basket gave lower weight estimates than those who were told they would have to lift it by themselves. “We plan our actions guided partly by what we think we can achieve with others,” wrote one of the researchers who conducted the basket experiment.
> 有合作者会改变我们对现实的感知。在一项实验中，志愿者在触摸之前被要求估算一篮土豆的重量。那些被告知有人会帮助他们搬篮子的人，比被告知要自己搬的人给出的重量估算要低。“我们的行动计划部分由我们认为与他人可以共同完成的事情所引导，”进行那次篮子实验的一位研究者写道。

In a world that emphasizes individual achievement the successful CEO, the MVP, the star - we often forget that everyone is descended from millions of people who survived because they didn’t go it alone. In the thousands of years that molded human nature, our ancestors required not only individual wits and strength, but also the ability to collaborate - to discern, trust, sacrifice, empathize, and intelligently combine their efforts with someone else. “The evolution of human beings has consisted largely of adaptation to one another,” wrote one commentator. Hunters who worked together were more likely to return with a kill. Two men who agreed to help each other improved their odds of fending off mutual enemies.
> 在一个强调个人成就的世界里——成功的首席执行官、最有价值球员、明星——我们常常忘记，所有人都源自数百万个因为不独自行动而得以生存的人。在塑造人性数千年的过程中，我们的祖先不仅需要个人的智慧与力量，还需要合作的能力——辨别、信任、牺牲、共情，并与他人智能地结合努力。“人类的进化在很大程度上是相互适应的过程，”一位评论者写道。一起狩猎的人更有可能带着猎物回来。两个人约定互相帮助，就能提高共同抵御敌人的几率。

Yet over time, humans created so many conveniences that we now can survive without each other. We live indoors rather than in the elements. We can eat microwavable dinners instead of hauling in a fish net with someone else. We no longer tell real stories around the fire; we turn on the TV and watch familiar strangers pretend.
> 然而，随着时间推移，人类创造了太多便利，以至于我们现在可以互不依赖而生存。我们住在室内而非在风雨中。我们可以吃微波炉加热的晚餐，而不必与他人一起拉渔网。我们不再在篝火旁讲述真实的故事；我们打开电视，看着熟悉的陌生人表演。

POWER OF 2

> 二人之力

Cubicles and private offices were bad enough; at least we would pass each other in the hall or gather for lunch. Now we can telecommute, staying in our home offices and e-mailing the work we did by ourselves. One hiring manager complained the job candidates she sees are “so used to texting, they don’t even know how to carry on a basic conversation with other people.” We are collaborative creatures in a newly do-it-yourself world.
> 隔间和独立办公室已经够糟糕了；至少我们还会在走廊相遇或聚在一起吃午饭。现在我们可以远程办公，呆在家庭办公室，把自己独立完成的工作通过电子邮件发出去。一位招聘经理抱怨，她见到的求职者“太习惯发短信了，甚至不知道如何与他人进行基本的对话。”我们是需要协作的生物，却生活在一个新兴的自己动手的世界中。

Isolation is bad for you. It poses dangers as serious as cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, or lack of exercise, one research summary concluded. Conversely, the more good partnerships you have in your life, the more likely you are to say that you experienced the feeling of enjoyment much of the day yesterday, that you recently learned something interesting, and that you’ve been doing a lot of smiling and laughing - all key measures of your happiness. Even having one strong partnership markedly increases your well-being over those who have none.
> 孤立对你有害。一项研究综述得出结论，它带来的危险堪比吸烟、高血压、高胆固醇、肥胖或缺乏运动。相反，你生活中拥有的良好伙伴关系越多，你越有可能说昨天大部分时间感到享受、最近学到了一些有趣的东西、并且一直在大量微笑和大笑——这些都是衡量幸福的关键指标。即便只有一段牢固的伙伴关系，也能明显提高你的福祉，胜过那些没有任何伙伴关系的人。

In the workplace, employees with just one collaborative relationship are 29 percent more likely to say they will stay with their company for the next year and 42 percent more likely to intend to remain with their current employer for their entire career, compared to those with no partnerships. Those who feel well-teamed with one or more colleagues are substantially more engaged at work. They generate higher customer scores and better safety, retention, creativity, productivity, and profitability for the business - and a greater level of happiness for themselves.
> 在职场上，与他人仅有一段协作关系的员工，比起没有任何合作伙伴的人，表示在未来一年内会留在公司的人概率高出 29%，并且表示愿意在整个职业生涯中继续留在当前雇主处的人概率高出 42%。那些感觉与一位或多位同事配合良好的人，在工作中参与度明显更高。他们带来更高的客户评分、更好的安全性、留任率、创造力、生产力和盈利能力——同时也为自己带来更高的幸福感。

For all of our collaborative instincts, most of us today form far fewer strong partnerships than we could, or than we should. Gallup’s research reveals that the median number of work partnerships for an American employee is just four, but even that number hides a more troubling truth. The small proportion of people who have dozens of close teammates inflates the statistic. When asked how many strong alliances they have, most people say they have just a few, even though the highest levels of happiness and employee engagement kick in when a person has 5 to 10 good alliances.
> 尽管我们都有合作的本能，但如今大多数人的强有力伙伴关系远少于可能建立的数量，也少于应有的数量。盖洛普的研究显示，美国员工的工作伙伴关系中位数仅为四位，但即便这一数字也掩盖了一个更令人不安的事实。那少数拥有数十位亲密队友的人抬高了这一统计值。当被问及他们有多少强有力的联盟时，大多数人都说只有少数几位，尽管人的最高幸福感和员工参与度出现在拥有 5 到 10 个良好联盟时。

The most disturbing statistic is that the most common number of work partnerships - the answer given by 16 percent of the population - is zero. Asked if they have ever had a great partnership at work, nearly one-quarter of employees say no.
> 最令人不安的统计数据是，最常见的工作伙伴数量——占人口 16%的回答——是零。被问及他们是否曾在工作中拥有过出色的合作关系，近四分之一的员工表示没有。

“The sad thing is that l’ve never had a successful partnership,” one businessperson told us. “I’ve been thrown into the leadership role in every single ‘group project’ or organized group outside or inside of school. Every time, I’ve become the leader, ended up doing the majority of the work, and gotten the majority of the credit. I’ve learned - again sadly - that I’m better at taking care of my responsibilities myself and not depending on others for creative success in my personal, artistic, or professional futures.”
> “一件令人难过的事是我从未有过一次成功的合作关系，”一位商界人士告诉我们。“在每一次‘小组项目’或校内外任何有组织的小组中，我都被推到领导角色。每次我都成为了领导，最终完成了大部分工作，并获得了大部分荣誉。我学到了——再次说明令人难过——与其依赖他人在我的个人、艺术或职业未来中取得创造性成功，我更擅长自己承担责任，自己完成。”

“In thinking through my best and worst work partnerships,” said one manager at a medical device manufacturer, "I keep seeing more experiences in the ‘worst’ column and a sparsely populated ‘best’ section.’
> “在回顾我最好的和最糟的工作合作时，”一家医疗器械制造商的经理说，“我不断看到‘最糟’栏目的经历更多，而‘最好’栏目则稀少。”

At the highest corporate levels, flying solo can have consequences for all the employees and shareholders. As the two of us began circulating Gallup’s partnership discoveries inside some of the world’s most prominent companies, we were surprised at how readily an acrimonious relationship at the top came to mind among those who have to tiptoe around the landmines.
> 在最高的公司层面，单打独斗会对所有员工和股东产生影响。当我们二人开始在一些世界上最知名的公司内部传播盖洛普关于伙伴关系的发现时，我们惊讶地发现，那些不得不在地雷区里小心行事的人们，很容易就会想到高层之间充满仇恨的关系。

“Grace and Randy hate each other,” said one midlevel executive. “They say all the right things in meetings, but that’s just for show. They have separate empires. You’re either on Grace’s team or on Randy’s team.” Whether the rift is between the chief operating officer and the chief financial officer or between the top marketing executive and the head of sales, such failures to collaborate are seldom private, nor are they trivial for the rest of the organization. Companies that should be concentrating on the battle with the competition are instead consuming their resources waging elaborate civil wars between the camps of Executive A and Executive B.
> “格蕾丝和兰迪互相憎恨，”一位中层高管说。“他们在会议上会说所有正确的话，但那只是表面功夫。他们各自经营着自己的王国。你不是格蕾丝团队的人，就是兰迪团队的人。”无论分裂发生在首席运营官与首席财务官之间，还是在最高市场主管与销售主管之间，这类无法合作的状况很少是私事，对组织其他成员也并非无关紧要。本应专注于与竞争对手较量的公司，反而耗费资源在执行官 A 和执行官 B 两派之间进行精心策划的内斗。

Equally troublesome is the concentration of power in the hands of a lone leader whose human foibles cannot help but be magnified under the pressure of having to be too many things to too many people. “America’s most serious corporate governance problem is the Imperial CEO - a leader who is both chairman of the company’s board of directors as well as its chief executive officer,” wrote former Northwest Airlines Chairman Gary Wilson, who served on the boards of Yahoo! and Disney. “Such a CEO can dominate his board and is accountable to no one.” Companies need, he argued, not one at the top, but two.
> 同样令人担忧的是权力集中在孤独的领导者手中，当一个人不得不对太多人承担太多责任时，他的人性弱点在压力下往往会被放大。“美国最严重的公司治理问题是皇帝式的首席执行官——既担任公司董事会主席又担任首席执行官的领导人，”曾在雅虎和迪士尼董事会任职的前西北航空董事长加里·威尔逊写道。“这样的首席执行官可以支配他的董事会，不对任何人负责。”他主张，公司顶层需要的不是一个人，而是两个人。

Seeing these patterns at numerous client companies, the two of us teamed up to lead what became a five-year endeavor to crack the code on collaboration, to discover what elements are crucial for two people becoming a successful team. We found the answers in some fascinating areas: in research showing how monkeys react when working in pairs, in a computerized friend-or-foe contest that baffled the experts, in studies of revenge, and in “irrational” acts of self-sacrifice.
> 在众多客户公司中观察到这些模式后，我们俩联手领导了一项历时五年的努力，旨在破解协作的密码，发现两个人成为成功团队的关键要素。我们在一些引人入胜的领域找到了答案：在研究猴子成对工作时的反应、在让专家们困惑的计算机化“朋友或敌人”竞赛、在复仇研究以及在“非理性”的自我牺牲行为中。

We also launched waves of original Gallup research to identify the dimensions of partnership and to determine how to best measure them. We analyzed the responses of thousands of people in search of the variables that are best at differentiating between a great partnership and a poor one. People from all walks of life scored their working relationships with their coworkers, fellow volunteers, other students, managers, and hundreds of others with whom they regularly interact. As we studied the stories of successful partners, famous and obscure, these aspects came into stark relief.
> 我们还发起了一系列盖洛普的原创研究，以识别伙伴关系的维度并确定如何最好地衡量它们。我们分析了数千人的回答，寻找那些最能将优秀伙伴关系与糟糕伙伴关系区分开的变量。来自各行各业的人对他们与同事、志愿者伙伴、其他学生、经理以及数百位他们经常互动的人的工作关系进行了评分。当我们研究那些成名或默默无闻的成功伙伴的故事时，这些方面变得格外清晰。

Throughout your life, you have opportunities to build hundreds of partnerships. Some are brief relationships to accomplish a modest goal. Others last years, even decades. These opportunities and relationships are often poorly understood and frequently mismanaged.
> 在你的一生中，你有机会建立数百种伙伴关系。有些是为实现小目标而建立的短期关系。另一些则持续多年，甚至数十年。这些机会和关系常常被误解，也经常被管理不当。

Why do some people click and others clash? Why do some people have dozens of great partnerships while others have none? Great partnerships don’t just happen. Whether
> 为什么有些人相处融洽而有些人冲突不断？为什么有些人拥有数十个优秀的伙伴关系而另一些人一个都没有？优秀的伙伴关系不会凭空出现。无论如何

your joint mission is to build a successful company, coach a team, improve the government, do something spectacular for a charity, or any other worthy goal, all successful partnerships share the same crucial ingredients. Although the answers to what makes a great collaboration were scattered across many sources and scientific disciplines, when combined, they make a cohesive set of insights you can use to make the most of your partnerships at work and in your personal life.
> 无论你们的共同使命是创办一家成功的公司、带领一支团队、改善政府、为某个慈善机构做些惊人的事，还是实现其他任何有价值的目标，所有成功的伙伴关系都共享相同的关键要素。虽然关于构成卓越协作的要素的答案散见于许多来源和不同的科学学科，但将它们结合起来，就形成了一套连贯的见解，能够帮助你在工作和个人生活中最大限度地利用伙伴关系。

The research revealed eight elements of a powerful partnership:
> 研究揭示了强大伙伴关系的八个要素：

Complementary Strengths: Everyone has weaknesses and blind spots that create obstacles to reaching a goal. One of the most powerful reasons for teaming up is working with someone who is strong where you are weak, and vice versa. Specialization allows both people to spend more time doing what each does best and allows the two to tackle together challenges neither could alone. Individuals are not wellrounded, but pairs can be.
> 互补优势：每个人都有弱点和盲点，这些都会成为实现目标的障碍。结成伙伴关系的最有力理由之一就是与在你薄弱之处强的人合作，反之亦然。专业分工让双方能把更多时间花在各自最擅长的事情上，也使两人能够共同应对任何一方单独无法解决的挑战。个人并不全面，但两人可以做到。

A Common Mission: It may seem as if the pursuit of a shared goal is so basic to a collaboration that it goes without saying. Yet when a partnership fails, the root cause is often that the two people were pursuing separate agendas. Conversely, when partners want the same thing badly enough, they will make the personal sacrifices necessary to see it through.
> 共同的使命：追求共同目标看似是合作中最基本的要素，以至于不言自明。然而，当伙伴关系失败时，根本原因往往是双方各自追求不同的议程。相反，当合作伙伴都非常渴望同一件事时，他们会做出实现目标所需的个人牺牲。

Fairness: Humans have an instinctive need for fairness. It appears very early in childhood without any training. No one likes to be taken advantage of, to get the short end of
> 公平：人类天生有对公平的需求。这种需求在儿童早期就会出现，无需任何训练。没有人喜欢被占便宜，或在交易中吃亏。

the deal. Because the need for fairness runs deep, it is an essential quality of a strong partnership.
> 由于对公平的需求根深蒂固，它是稳固伙伴关系的一个关键品质。

Trust: Working with someone means taking risks. You are not likely to contribute your best work unless you trust that your partner will do her best. You need to rely on your counterpart to look out for your interests. She requires the same from you. Without trust, it’s easier to work alone.
> 信任：与他人合作意味着要承担风险。如果你不相信你的伙伴会尽力，你就不太可能贡献出最好的工作。你需要依赖对方为你的利益着想。她也需要你同样如此。没有信任，独自工作会变得更容易。

Acceptance: We see the world through our own set of lenses. What’s normal for one person is a serious flaw for another. Whenever two disparate personalities come together, there is bound to be a certain friction from their differences. This can be a recipe for conflict unless both learn to accept the idiosyncrasies of the other.
> 接受：我们通过各自的一套镜片看世界。对一个人来说正常的事，对另一个人可能是严重的缺陷。每当两个迥异的个性走到一起，他们之间的差异必然会带来某种摩擦。除非双方都学会接纳对方的怪癖，否则这可能成为冲突的导火索。

Forgiveness: People are imperfect. They make mistakes. They sometimes do the wrong thing. Without forgiveness, the natural revenge motives that stem from friend-orfoe instincts will overpower all the reasons to continue a partnership, and it will dissolve.
> 宽恕：人无完人。人会犯错，有时会做错事。如果没有宽恕，源自朋友或敌人本能的复仇动机就会压倒继续合作的所有理由，伙伴关系将会瓦解。

Communicating: The only way two minds can be united in one mission is if the pair communicates well. Without coordinating their moves, collaborators risk knocking heads or making deal-wrecking assumptions about the other’s intentions. In the early stages of a partnership, communicating helps to prevent misunderstandings and to assure each person of the other’s trustworthiness. Later in the relationship, a continuous flow of information makes the work more efficient by keeping the two people synchronized.
> 沟通：要让两颗心为同一使命而合二为一，唯一的途径是双方良好沟通。如果不协调彼此的行动，合作者就有可能碰撞出冲突，或对对方的意图做出毁约性的错误假设。在伙伴关系的早期，沟通有助于防止误解并向对方保证彼此的可信度。在关系的后期，持续的信息流通过保持双方同步，使工作更高效。

Unselfishness: Many people enter partnerships for selfish reasons; they can accomplish more collaborating than they can working solo. However, in the best working relationships, something happens along the way. Some researchers call it “mutuality” when the natural concern for your own welfare transforms into gratification in seeing your comrade succeed. Those who have reached this level say such collaborations become among the most fulfilling aspects of their lives. It is one thing to have accomplished a great goal by oneself, they say, but individual achievements cannot compare to doing a great thing together.
> 无私：许多人出于自私的原因进入合伙关系；与其单打独斗，他们在合作中能完成更多。然而，在最好的工作关系中，沿途会发生某种变化。一些研究者称之为“互惠性”，即对自身福祉的自然关切转变为看到同伴成功时的满足感。那些达到这一层次的人说，这样的合作成为他们生活中最令人充实的方面之一。他们认为，独自完成伟大目标是一回事，但个人成就无法与共同完成伟大事业相提并论。

When all these elements combine, partnerships become not just effective in accomplishing the mission, but also personally rewarding, sometimes intensely so. “If I were teaching students about entrepreneurship, I’d point out that many of the great startups of the last 30 years began as teams of two,” wrote Forbes Publisher Rich Karlgaard. “Behind this phenomenon is a principle: Build on your strengths. To mitigate your weaknesses - and we all have them - partner up! Find your complement.”
> 当所有这些要素结合在一起时，合作伙伴关系不仅能更有效地完成使命，而且在个人层面上也有回报，有时甚至是强烈的回报。福布斯出版人里奇·卡尔高德写道：“如果我要教学生创业，我会指出过去 30 年中许多伟大创业公司都是由两个合伙人起步的。这一现象背后有一个原则：建立在你的优势上。为了弥补你的弱点——我们都有——就去寻找伙伴！找到与你互补的人。”

Ultimately, if you can harness the same cooperative instincts that allowed your distant ancestors to survive, you will enjoy greater happiness. You can lighten your load, take advantage of your strengths, and achieve unprecedented success by being one of two people pursuing a shared mission. Take off the headphones. Break away from the screen. Get out of your office. And unleash the Power of 2.
> 最终，如果你能驾驭那些让你遥远的祖先得以生存的合作本能，你将获得更大的幸福。你可以减轻负担，利用自己的优势，并通过作为两个共同追求同一使命的人之一而取得前所未有的成功。摘下耳机。离开屏幕。走出办公室。释放二人力量。

Several decades ago, a junior high shop teacher wanted to impress upon his new students the dangers of the oxyacetylene torch. “Pay attention, class,” he said, pulling a balloon from his pocket and holding it to the nozzle of the torch. “I am going to fill this balloon with oxygen.” When the balloon was full, he lit a match under it, producing a strong pop. “Not bad, eh?” said the teacher, smiling at the rapt students.
> 几十年前，一位初中工艺老师想让新学生们认识到乙炔氧焊枪的危险。他一边从口袋里掏出一个气球，一边对喷嘴说：“同学们注意了，我要用氧气把这个气球充满。”当气球充满时，他在下面点燃了一根火柴，发出一声巨响。“不错吧？”老师对着入迷的学生们微笑道。

He pulled another balloon from his pocket. “Now this time, I am going to fill the balloon with acetylene,” he said. Following the same procedure, he made a short flare as the fuel caught fire. “Wow!” said the kids. “Cool!”
> 他又从口袋里掏出另一个气球。“这次我要把气球充满乙炔，”他说。按同样的做法，当燃料着火时产生了一阵短促的闪光。“哇！”孩子们说，“酷！”

The teacher pulled yet another balloon from his pocket. "You’ve seen what happens to each of these elements separately. Now let me show you what happens when I put
> 老师又从口袋里掏出另一个气球。“你们已经看到了这些成分各自单独发生的情况。现在让我给你们看看当我把”

> 双倍的力量

them together." He repeated the procedure a third time, opening the valves for the oxygen and the acetylene as the balloon grew larger. “You might want to plug your ears,” said the teacher, putting the flame to the latex.
> 把它们结合在一起。”他第三次重复了这个过程，在氢氧瓶阀门打开的同时，气球越吹越大。“你们最好塞住耳朵，”老师一边把火焰靠近乳胶一边说。

BAM!

> 砰！

The mixture exploded with such force, the students could hear it loudly despite their plugged ears. Their jaws dropped as they looked at one another. Point made.
> 混合气体以如此大的力量爆炸，即使塞了耳朵，学生们也能清晰听到。他们面面相觑，下巴都掉了。论点已经说明。

Was it the oxygen or the acetylene that caused the explosion? Neither. Or rather, both. Separately, they are impressive. Together, they create a mixture so hot it can melt steel. The power is in the combination.
> 是氧气还是乙炔引发了爆炸？都不是。或者说，两者都是。单独看，它们都很强大；合在一起，它们能产生足以融化钢铁的高温。力量存在于组合之中。

Your partnerships work on the same principle. The best happen when you and someone who has strengths that complement yours join forces and focus on a single goal. Your strengths cancel out your partner’s weaknesses, and vice versa. You accomplish together what could not be done separately.
> 你的合作关系遵循相同的原理。最好的合作发生在你与一个拥有能互补你优势的人联手、并专注于同一个目标时。你的优势可以弥补伙伴的弱点，反之亦然。你们一起完成了单独无法做到的事情。

Before you can forge a successful alliance, you must understand what you bring to the combination, and equally important, what you don’t. Collaboration is more than doubling up - more than just twice the oxygen or twice the acetylene. The key to achieving success is not trying to be someone else or striving to be as good as your collaborator at whatever he does best or seeking to be universally proficient. It’s in discovering your own exceptional abilities, recognizing your weaknesses, and understanding how someone else’s abilities complement your own.
> 在你锻造成功的联盟之前，必须先明白你能为组合带来什么，同样重要的，还有你不能带来的是什么。协作不仅仅是简单相加——不是把氧气或乙炔加倍。取得成功的关键不在于试图成为别人，或努力在对方最擅长的事上与他一样出色，或追求全能。关键在于发现你自己独特的能力，认识你的弱点，并理解别人的能力如何与你相互补足。

This combination of reciprocal abilities was at the heart of what we discovered during five years of research into collaboration. Through repeated waves of surveying, we asked thousands of randomly selected adults to identify a successful partnership and a failed one (outside of their family). We then asked them to respond to parallel statements about both of those relationships.
> 在我们对协作进行五年研究期间所发现的核心，正是这种互补能力的结合。通过多轮问卷调查，我们让数千名随机抽取的成年人分别指出一个成功的伙伴关系和一个失败的伙伴关系（家庭以外）。然后我们要求他们对这两段关系的相对应陈述作出回应。

Their responses were analyzed to identify the statements that, when answered positively, best predict collaborative success (and when answered negatively, best foreshadow failure). In the end, 23 statements made the cut to become part of the Gallup Partnership Rating Scales.
> 对他们的回答进行分析，以确定哪些陈述在被肯定回答时最能预测协作成功（而在被否定回答时最能预示失败）。最终，有 23 条陈述通过筛选，成为盖洛普伙伴关系评价量表的一部分。

Three of these statements emerged as the most important for determining how well your abilities mesh with those of your collaborator:
> 其中三条陈述被认定为判断你与合作者能力契合程度最重要的因素：

We complement each other’s strengths.
> 我们互补彼此的优势。

We need each other to get the job done.
> 我们需要彼此合作才能完成工作。

He or she does some things much better than I do, and I do some things much better than he or she does.
> 他或她在某些方面比我做得好得多，而我在某些方面比他或她做得好得多。

Survey participants rated their level of agreement with each of the statements on a scale from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”). Ratings that averaged less than 3.0 are classified as “poor” or “very poor.” These responses were typical of relationships in which the participant felt he or she could just as easily do something alone as rely on the other person. Scores of at least 3.0 but less than 3.6 are considered “borderline,” the ho-hum
> 调查参与者在每个陈述上按从 1（“完全不同意”）到 5（“完全同意”）的量表评定他们的认同程度。平均评分低于 3.0 的被归类为“差”或“非常差”。这些回答通常出现在参与者觉得自己独自完成某事和依赖对方同样容易的关系中。平均分至少为 3.0 但低于 3.6 的被视为“临界”——那种虽不见敌意但也缺乏强度的平淡地带

area that, while it may lack acrimony, also lacks intensity. Averages greater than 3.6 are in the “good” range.
> 平均大于 3.6 者属于“良好”范围。

We were surprised how strongly a collaborator had to score all three of these statements to demonstrate that he or she was in a resilient alliance. Only by answering 5 to all three statements does a participant indicate a level of complementary strengths that Gallup considers “exceptional.” Why no tolerance for less-than-perfect scores? Because the most important reference point on such a scale is not the middle, but the top. Answering 4 to any of the statements, while good in an absolute sense, also indicates a full point of reservation - something substantial that is keeping you from giving the most positive response. In practice, this holding back is costly. It reveals that you and your counterpart are not quite a perfect fit or don’t absolutely need each other to get the job done. In exceptional two-person teams, there is no such reservation.
> 我们很惊讶地发现，为了表明某位合作者处于一种有弹性的联盟中，他或她必须在这三项陈述上都打出很高的分数。只有对这三项陈述都回答 5 分，参与者才表明了盖洛普所认为的“卓越”互补优势。为什么不容许低于完美的分数？因为在这样的量表上，最重要的参照点不是中间，而是顶部。对任何一项陈述回答 4 分，虽然从绝对意义上看是好的，但也表明存在整整一分的保留——有某种重要的东西阻止你给出最积极的回应。在实践中，这种保留是有代价的。它表明你和你的搭档并非完全契合，或者并非彼此绝对需要才能完成任务。在卓越的双人团队中，不存在这种保留。

These statements reflect not just interdependence, but a mutual recognition of it. One person we interviewed told us how her creativity combined well with a colleague’s attention to details. Two producers of programming for a children’s medical center discovered that the understanding one had of the hospital’s communication needs complemented the other’s writing, editing, and video skills. Coeditors of a newsletter found that their work was effective because, as one of them said, “We each contributed something the other lacked, I a sense of style and she a specific political awareness, so that what we wrote wouldn’t embarrass anyone.”
> 这些陈述不仅反映了相互依赖，还反映了对这种依赖的相互认可。我们采访的一位受访者告诉我们，她的创造力与一位同事对细节的关注相得益彰。两位为一家儿童医疗中心制作节目的人发现，一个人对医院沟通需求的理解补足了另一个人在写作、编辑和视频制作方面的技能。一本通讯的共同编辑发现他们的工作之所以有效，正如其中一人所说，“我们各自贡献了对方所欠缺的东西，我有风格感，而她有具体的政治敏感度，这样我们写出来的东西就不会让任何人难堪。”

The characteristics that make a partnership solid could be anything from a physical attribute (the height of a basketball forward) or a credential (a medical license) to experience in a certain field (a decade as an architect) or personal reputation (a relationship with every media buyer in the market). You should be able to name these qualities for yourself and your counterpart without much hesitation: “I bring

to the partnership; my partner adds

qquad
\qquad
.”
> 使伙伴关系稳固的特质可以是任何东西，从身体特征（篮球前锋的身高）或资格证书（医师执照），到在某一领域的经验（十年的建筑师经历）或个人声誉（与市场上每一位媒介采购人员都有关系）。你应该能够毫不犹豫地为自己和你的搭档说出这些品质：“我为伙伴关系带来的是

qquad
\qquad
> ；我的伙伴补充的是

qquad
\qquad
。”

Anything crucial to accomplishing the goal that one person lacks and the other has increases your rationale for working together. Sometimes what’s required is the difference in how the two of you think or act. One consistently sees the potential; the other routinely sees the risks. One generates ideas; the other puts them into production. One is good with technology; the other is good with people.
> 任何对实现目标至关重要而一个人缺乏、另一个人具备的东西，会增强你们共同合作的理由。有时所需的正是你们两人在思维或行为方式上的差异。一个人始终能看到潜力；另一个常常看到风险。一个提出想法；另一个把想法付诸生产。一个擅长技术；另一个擅长与人打交道。

A successful collaborator must resist the ego-gratifying temptation to take too much credit. If a person honestly recognizes that his counterpart does some things much better than he does and that he needs the other person to get the job done, he is less susceptible to fall into the trap of conceit. In a strong partnership, both participants are always promoting the abilities of the other. They constantly speak in terms of “we” or “us,” rather than “I” or “me.”
> 一个成功的合作者必须抵制那种令自我满足的诱惑，即过多地争取功劳。如果一个人诚实地认识到他的搭档在某些事情上远胜于他自己，且他需要对方来完成工作，那么他就不太可能陷入自负的陷阱。在强有力的伙伴关系中，双方总是在推广对方的能力。他们始终以“我们”或“咱们”来表达，而不是“我”。

People often confuse collaboration with friendship, but they are not the same thing. While getting along is important to both kinds of relationships, if you team up with a buddy whose strengths do not complement your

own, don’t be surprised if you find yourselves being more social than successful. Some of your best potential partners are people with whom you have yet to build strong personal rapport but who nonetheless have the oxygen to go with your acetylene.
> 有时候，别惊讶于你们比成功更善于社交。有些最有潜力成为你伙伴的人，是那些你们尚未建立起深厚私人关系的人，但他们恰好拥有配合你“乙炔”的“氧气”。

Strong partnerships prevail despite a persistent cultural bias for focusing on individual achievements. Many observers of a two-person team want to know which of them is the real reason for their success, failing to understand that neither is the complete equation.
> 尽管文化上长期偏向关注个人成就，优秀的伙伴关系仍能占上风。很多人观察双人组合时，总想知道到底是谁才是真正的成功原因，却不理解两者都不是完整答案。

Oxygen and acetylene met in Salt Lake City in 1985, when the Utah Jazz drafted Karl Malone from Louisiana Tech University, making him a teammate of point guard John Stockton. They were markedly different men who, over the next 18 years, would achieve more than any other duo in professional basketball. Yet even when their complementary abilities were on public display, they encountered the same pervasive bias that only one of them must be the secret to their shared success.
> 氧气和乙炔在 1985 年于盐湖城相遇，当时犹他爵队从路易斯安那理工大学选中了卡尔·马龙，使他成为控球后卫约翰·斯托克顿的队友。他们是截然不同的人，接下来的 18 年里，他们取得的成就超过了职业篮球历史上任何其他二人组。即便他们互补的能力在公众面前明显可见，人们仍然怀有那种普遍偏见，认为他们的共同成功之中一定只有一个人是秘诀。

When Stockton joined Utah the year before Malone, he was third in line behind established starter Rickey Green and backup Jerry Eaves. Quiet, humble, and only 6-foot-1, Stockton was so concerned that his first year with the Jazz would be his last that he held out for an extra

into his rookie season, when he bought a TV for his onebedroom apartment to watch the Super Bowl. His concern was misplaced. Stockton set new Jazz rookie records with 109 steals and 415 assists, despite averaging only 18 minutes per game, less than half the time he would typically play in future years.
> ，买了一台电视放在他的一居室公寓里看超级碗。他的担忧是多余的。尽管场均上场时间只有 18 分钟——不到他未来年份通常出场时间的一半——斯托克顿仍创造了爵士队新秀记录：109 次抢断和 415 次助攻。

Malone entered the professional draft at an intimidating 6 -foot- 9 and 256 pounds, large enough to hold his own near the basket, fast enough to beat other forwards down the court, and a solid shooter outside. He earned the nickname “Mailman” in college because, it was said, he always delivered. For all that, 12 teams passed him over before the Jazz selected him in the first round of the draft.
> 马龙以令人畏惧的身高 6 英尺 9 寸、体重 256 磅进入职业选秀，身材足以在篮下抗衡，速度足以在攻防转换中甩开其他前锋，且外线投篮稳健。他在大学时得了“邮差”（Mailman）这个绰号，因人们说他总是能送达所需。尽管如此，选秀时已有 12 支球队错过了他，直到爵士在首轮选中了他。

As a higher profile acquisition and a bigger player than Stockton, Malone got more chances to shine as a rookie, averaging almost 31 minutes per game. The early reviews were good. In his first season, he put the ball through the hoop once every four minutes and six seconds he was on the court.
> 作为比斯托克顿更引人注目的新秀和更重要的球员，马龙在新秀赛季有更多出场机会，场均上场时间接近 31 分钟。早期评价很不错。在他的第一个赛季里，每当他在场上，他平均每四分零六秒就能把球送进篮筐一次。

While Malone proved himself, Stockton improved himself. He got more playing time - over 23 minutes per game - and made better use of it. The frequency of his baskets increased from once every six-and-a-half minutes on the court to once every six minutes and eight seconds. He stole the ball from the opposing team almost twice a game, and he shaved 25 seconds off his time between assists.
> 与此同时，斯托克顿在证明自己的同时也在提升自己。他获得了更多出场时间——场均超过 23 分钟——并且更好地利用了这些时间。他的得分频率从每上场六分半钟进一球提高到每上场六分零八秒进一球。他每场差不多能从对方手中抢断一次（近两次），而且助攻之间的间隔缩短了 25 秒。

As Stockton and Malone each improved their own games and earned more time on the court, they had more

opportunities to work together. Four games into the 1987-1988 season, Jazz coach Frank Layden made Stockton the starter, giving him 50 percent more playing time. The stage was set for the Stockton-Malone partnership to emerge. As the accolades for both players rolled in, reporters began noticing the synergy between them.
> 合作的机会。1987-1988 赛季刚进行到第四场，爵队教练弗兰克·莱登就让斯托克顿成为首发，给了他 50%更多的上场时间。斯托克顿—马龙的搭档由此有了登场的舞台。当两位球员的赞誉接连而至时，记者们也开始注意到他们之间的协同作用。

Under Layden’s strategy, the point guard had the ball much of the time, so it was not surprising that his new starter in that position was putting up good numbers. “There are two other major reasons why Stockton gets a lot of assists - Karl Malone posting up on the blocks and Karl Malone steaming down court on the fast break. An assist man needs a ‘finisher,’” wrote Jack McCallum in a 1988 Sports Illustrated article, “and it’s no secret that Stockton is looking for the ‘Mailman’ most of the time.”
> 在莱登的战术下，控球后卫大部分时间握球，因此他在该位置上的新首发拿出好数据并不令人意外。“斯托克顿能送出大量助攻还有两个主要原因——卡尔·马龙在肘区背打，以及卡尔·马龙在快攻中疾驰得分。一个助攻型球员需要一个‘终结者’，”杰克·麦卡勒姆在 1988 年《体育画报》的一篇文章中写道，“而且毫无疑问，斯托克顿大部分时间都在寻找这位‘邮差’。”

A chemistry, mutual respect, and at times eerie coordination formed between the two men. Equally obsessed with winning, they worked tirelessly and found a rhythm together. “I’ve never seen Karl tired,” said Stockton. “He’s on a different level than the rest of us.” They developed a personal bond that was greater than their interdependence on the court. “What John Stockton doesn’t know is that he is like one of my older brothers to me, and not because he gives me the ball on the break,” said Malone. “Mess with Stockton, and you mess with me.”
> 两人之间形成了一种化学反应、相互尊重，有时甚至是令人惊异的默契。他们同样对胜利着迷，不知疲倦地努力，找到了共同的节奏。“我从来没见过卡尔累，”斯托克顿说。“他和我们其他人不在一个层次上。”他们建立起一种超越场上相互依赖的私人情感纽带。“约翰·斯托克顿不知道的是，他对我来说就像我的一个大哥，这并不是因为他在快攻时把球传给我，”马龙说。“惹到斯托克顿，就是惹到我。”

They formed their alliance even though, in many respects, they were opposites. Malone constantly talked about himself, often in the third person. “The best thing that could have

> 马隆说，“卡尔·马龙遇到的情况是，他来到盐湖城。”他与爵士队老板拉里·米勒的公开争执成了当地新闻报道的常客。

Stockton, on the other hand, not only avoided selfanalysis, he didn’t even like talking about himself in response to direct questions from reporters. “You talk about yourself and it’s such an individual-sounding thing,” he told one sportswriter. “To me, it’s offensive. I’m just not comfortable with it. I guess if I played an individual sport like tennis or something, I’d be out of a job. I just don’t think in terms of ‘I did this’ or ‘I did that.’”
> 另一方面，斯托克顿不仅回避自我分析，他甚至不喜欢在面对记者的直接提问时谈论自己。“你谈论自己，这听起来太个人化了，”他对一位体育记者说。“对我来说，这令人反感。我只是对此不舒服。我想如果我参加像网球之类的个人运动，我就没戏了。我就是不以‘我做了这个’或‘我做了那个’来思考。”

Malone drove a shiny Harley-Davidson motorcycle and wore a leather fringe jacket and cowboy boots. He bought a semitrailer and had it painted with what one writer called “a striking Western mural that suggests Frederic Remington on an acid trip.” The lead cowboy in the mural was Malone himself.
> 马龙骑着一辆闪亮的哈雷-戴维森摩托，穿着带流苏的皮夹克和牛仔靴。他买了一辆半挂车，并请人把车身漆成一位作家所称的“带有强烈西部风格的壁画，仿佛弗雷德里克·雷明顿在迷幻之旅上的作品”。壁画中的主角牛仔就是马龙本人。

Stockton drove a Chevy Suburban and wore golf shirts, khakis, and white sneakers. When he got married, he made sure the announcement in his hometown newspaper said only that the groom was “employed in Salt Lake City.” He called his life away from basketball “pretty boring,” seeking to dissuade public interest in his life as much as Malone welcomed the attention.
> 斯托克顿开着一辆雪佛兰 Suburban，穿着高尔夫衫、卡其裤和白色运动鞋。他结婚时，特意在家乡报纸上的结婚公告里只写道新郎“在盐湖城工作”。他称自己篮球场外的生活“相当无聊”，尽力让公众对他的私生活失去兴趣，而马龙则欢迎公众的关注。

But it was their complementary differences on the court that put them in the record books. Stockton played the role of “field general,” setting up the play. Malone’s talent was executing in the key. "To my eye, it seemed like the real ghue

that held the relationship together was the understanding of how much each one needed the other," said Michael C. Lewis, a Salt Lake Tribune sports reporter who wrote a book about the team. “There was a real full understanding on each of their parts that where they were trying to go, which was to win an NBA championship, neither one of them was going to get there without the other.”
> 是彼此理解对方有多需要自己，”为这支球队写过书的《盐湖先驱报》体育记者迈克尔·C·刘易斯说道。“他们双方都真正充分理解，为了他们想达到的目标——赢得 NBA 总冠军——没有任何一方能不依靠另一方而独自到达那里。”

As it became increasingly successful on the court, the partnership flummoxed the statisticians and observers. Sportswriters insisted on trying to isolate one man’s performance from the other. The rhythm between Malone and Stockton really threw them.
> 随着球队在赛场上越来越成功，这段搭档让统计学家和观察者们感到困惑。体育记者们坚持要把一个人的表现从另一个人中分离出来。马龙与斯托克顿之间的节奏确实让他们大为惊讶。

“As long as Stockton is around, Malone will never get full credit for being a great player. The question of who’s more important - Malone or Stockton, scorer or passer - is a chicken-or-egg conundrum that simply can’t be solved. And the more success they have as a tandem, the more complex the question becomes,” wrote Sports Illustrated. “Neither Malone nor Stockton will become the MVP as long as they play together: They cancel each other out.”
> “只要斯托克顿还在，马龙就永远无法得到充分的认可，认为他是一名伟大的球员。谁更重要——马龙还是斯托克顿，是得分手还是传球手——这是一个鸡生蛋还是蛋生鸡的难题，根本无法解开。而且他们作为搭档取得的成功越多，这个问题就越复杂，”《体育画报》写道。“只要他们一起打球，马龙和斯托克顿都不会成为最有价值球员：他们互相抵消。”

Nothing exemplifies the coordination between the two players better than what happened in Game 4 of the 1997 NBA Finals. After being down 71-66 to the Chicago Bulls, Stockton nearly evened the score with a three-pointer and three free throws matched by just one basket from the Bulls.
> 没有什么比 1997 年 NBA 总决赛第四场发生的事情更能体现两人之间的配合。爵士在落后公牛 71 比 66 时，斯托克顿几乎以一记三分球和三次罚球将比分扳平，而公牛仅以一记进球回应。

missed. Stockton, who had sneaked up to the basket, got the rebound. He turned and fired the ball down the court, where Malone was racing just ahead of Jordan. It was an extremely risky play. “If you could have suspended time right then, when the ball was in the air, [Jazz coach] Jerry [Sloan] probably would have strangled me,” said Stockton. “I saw Karl had position, and when he does, he’s the best at getting the ball.”
> 错失了。斯托克顿偷偷跑到篮下，抢到篮板。他转身把球抛向全场，马龙在前面紧追乔丹。这是个极其冒险的举动。“如果当时能把时间暂停一下，在球还在空中的那一刻，[爵士教练]杰里[斯隆]可能会掐死我，”斯托克顿说。“我看到卡尔占了位置，而他一占位置，就是最擅长接球的人。”

Malone had similar faith in his teammate. “I knew Michael was back there, lurking, but I also knew that if anybody could get the pass to me, it was Stock,” said the forward. “When he threw it, I thought, 'Well, Stock doesn’t throw bad passes, so I must be open.” 'The ball landed in Malone’s hands, and he made a layup to put Utah in the lead for good. The play was so improbable that sportswriters dubbed it simply “The Pass.” The next morning’s Salt Lake Tribume reported that the capacity home-arena crowd “probably still doesn’t believe what it saw.”
> 马龙对队友也有同样的信任。“我知道迈克尔在那儿盯着，但我也知道如果有人能把球传给我，那就是斯托克，”这位前锋说。“当他传球时，我心想，‘斯托克不会传坏球，所以我一定是空的。’”球落到马龙手中，他上篮得手，让犹他队终场前反超。这记球太不可思议了，体育记者干脆称之为“那记传球”。第二天早晨的盐湖城论坛报报道说，坐满的主场观众“可能至今仍不相信自己所看到的一切。”

The Utah Jazz never won the NBA championship with Malone and Stockton. They came excruciatingly close in 1997 and 1998, a major accomplishment for the team from the league’s smallest market. The prediction that neither man would win the MVP title was just plain wrong. Malone would go on to win it twice, not in spite of his partnership with Stockton, but because of it. The men were co-MVPs of the 1993 All-Star Game. Stockton was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009, his first year of eligibility, almost certain to be followed by Malone.
> 犹他爵士队在马龙和斯托克顿时期从未赢得过 NBA 总冠军。他们在 1997 年和 1998 年痛失冠军，已是对这支来自联盟最小市场球队的一项重大成就。那种说两人都无法获得常规赛 MVP 的预测纯属错误。马龙后来两次获得该奖，这并非与斯托克顿的搭档无关，而恰恰是因为这一搭档。他们是 1993 年全明星赛的共同 MVP。斯托克顿在 2009 年首次获资格就入选了篮球名人堂，马龙几乎也必将随后被入选。

A pernicious idea works its way through classrooms, into corporate training departments, and even around the dinner table in many homes. There’s a good chance it hampers your working relationships. It goes by various names: the well-rounded person, the Renaissance man, bomo universalis, or the polymath (from the Greek word polymathēs, meaning “having learned much”). It is the belief that anyone can accomplish anything alone with enough determination and perseverance.
> 一种有害的观念在课堂上蔓延，进入企业培训部门，甚至在许多家庭的餐桌旁流传。很可能它正在阻碍你的工作关系。它有许多名字：全面发展的人，博学多才的人，博学家（拉丁语 bomo universalis），或博学者（源自希腊词 polymathēs，意为“学识渊博”）。这种观念认为，只要有足够的决心和毅力，任何人都能独自完成任何事情。

Blame Leonardo da Vinci. His gifts for drawing and painting, his understanding of anatomy, and his penchant for inventing labeled him a universal genius and led millions to wonder why they had not done such remarkable things. Blame Thomas Jefferson, whose interests ranged from politics to science to architecture to agriculture. Or blame the creators of heroes such as Spider-Man, MacGyver, and James Bond - characters who appeal to us because they are self-sufficient in any crisis. We want to be like that.
> 把这归咎于莱昂纳多·达·芬奇。他在绘画和素描上的天赋、对解剖学的理解以及热衷发明的性格，使他被贴上了“通才”的标签，并让数百万人怀疑自己为何未能做出如此非凡的事。把它归咎于托马斯·杰斐逊，他的兴趣从政治到科学、从建筑到农业无所不包。或者将责任归于创造出蜘蛛侠、机智缜密的麦克加弗和詹姆斯·邦德等英雄的人——这些角色在任何危机中都自给自足，因而对我们有吸引力。我们也想成为那样的人。

This fallacy has tremendous traction in the popular press. Self-help gurus such as Tony Robbins chide their followers for hiding behind “excuses.” “Using the power of decision gives you the capacity to get past any excuse to change any and every part of your life in an instant,” Robbins wrote in his bestseller Awaken the Giant Within. “If you truly decide to,” he wrote in bold type, “you can do almost anything.”
> 这种谬论在大众媒体中极具影响力。自我帮助类的导师如托尼·罗宾斯会责备追随者藏在“借口”后面。“运用决定的力量能让你有能力越过任何借口，在瞬间改变生活的任何和每一部分，”罗宾斯在他的畅销书《唤醒内在的巨人》中写道。“如果你真正决定了，”他以加粗字体写道，“你几乎可以做任何事。”

One book purports to help the reader learn “how to think like Leonardo da Vinci.” Another book by the same author promises to teach a person how to “innovate like Edison.” “Genius is made, not born. And human beings are gifted with an almost unlimited potential,” proclaims the back cover of the da Vinci book.
> 有一本书宣称能帮助读者学会“像列奥纳多·达·芬奇那样思考”。同一位作者的另一本书则承诺教人如何“像爱迪生那样创新”。达·芬奇那本书的封底宣称：“天才是培养出来的，不是天生的。人类被赋予几乎无限的潜能。”

Few ideas so widely accepted are so demonstrably wrong. The polymath is a myth. It contradicts reason, the latest research on genetic inheritance, human nature, and even the Bible (which speaks of “diversities of gifts” among different people). Da Vinci was an incredible artist and thinker, but he often struggled to finish his work. For all his talents, Jefferson was horrible at handling money, dying deeply in debt. He seemed organically incapable of the kinds of constructive confrontations that were welcomed by his sometime collaborator John Adams. And fictional characters such as James Bond are just that - fiction.
> 很少有被广泛接受的观念能被证明如此错误。博学多才者是个神话。它与理性相悖，也与最新的遗传学研究、人性，甚至《圣经》（其中谈到人们之间“恩赐各有不同”）相违背。达·芬奇是位了不起的艺术家和思想家，但他常常难以完成自己的作品。尽管才华横溢，杰斐逊在理财方面却糟透了，死时深陷债务。他似乎天生无法进行那种他的偶尔合作者约翰·亚当斯所欢迎的建设性对抗。诸如詹姆斯·邦德这样的虚构人物也只是虚构而已。

The pressure to be all things to all people is pervasive.

When people are asked to rate themselves, researchers often find what they call the “Lake Wobegon effect,” nearly everyone believing that they are above average on just about everything. A majority of Swedish drivers think they drive better than average. Most undergraduates believe they have above-average popularity. People scoring in the bottom 25 percent on tests of humor, of grammar, and of logic grossly overestimate their test performance and ability.
> 当人们被要求对自己打分时，研究者经常发现所谓的“沃贝贡湖效应”，几乎每个人都认为自己在几乎所有方面都高于平均水平。大多数瑞典司机认为自己开车比平均水平更好。大多数大学本科生认为他们的人气高于平均值。在幽默、语法和逻辑测试中得分位于最低 25%的人，这些人严重高估了自己的测试表现和能力。

The flip side of this phenomenon is that people who excel at a task often think their work is unexceptional. They take for granted what comes naturally to them, assuming that others can perform the task just as well. Their overestimation of others’ abilities leads them to suffer what one study called “undue modesty” about their own strengths.
> 这种现象的另一面是，那些在某项任务上表现出色的人往往认为自己的工作并不特别。他们把对自己来说顺其自然的事情视为理所当然，认为别人也能做得同样好。他们对他人能力的高估使得他们对自己优势产生一种研究称之为“过度谦逊”的看法。

As a consequence of these misconceptions, most people see themselves as more well-rounded than they really are, above average where they are weak, and close to average where they are incredible. But they’re wrong. Instead of complete circles, people are puzzle pieces. Some aspects of their aptitude dramatically exceed those of the general population, while other qualities are well below the mean.
> 由于这些误解，大多数人认为自己比实际更为全面：在薄弱之处高估自己，在擅长之处却觉得接近平均水平。但他们错了。人并非完整的圆，而是拼图块。他们在某些能力方面远超一般人群，而在其他品质上则远低于平均水平。

Great partners know where they are strong and where they are weak. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, discovered the “analytic powerhouse” he needed for the business in Stanford MBA Jeff Skoll. “It was the perfect balance,” Omidyar said of his work with Skoll. “I tended to think more intuitively, and he could say, 'Okay, let’s see how we can actually get that done.” Skoll was intensely ambitious, which helped with running the business; Omidyar was more laid-back, which helped him work with the growing group of buyers and sellers.
> 优秀的伙伴知道自己何处强、何处弱。eBay 创始人皮埃尔·奥米迪亚在斯坦福商学院的 MBA 杰夫·斯科尔身上找到了他所需要的“分析型强者”。奥米迪亚谈到与斯科尔的合作时说：“这是完美的平衡。我倾向于更直觉地思考，而他会说，‘好吧，让我们看看如何真正把它做成。’”斯科尔雄心勃勃，这有助于经营业务；奥米迪亚则更为随和，这有助于他与日益增长的买家和卖家群体打交道。

The same pattern emerges in common working relationships. “I was in a retail business with another woman for about 15 years,” one woman told Gallup. “She was a born leader, and I didn’t mind because I am more reticent.

> 在那方面很自信，市场采购、商品陈列等。我以前一直在办公室工作，耐心更多，也负责记账。我们配合得很好，因为我们性格不同。”

So admit it: You stink at some things. You have blind spots, weaknesses, areas in which others seem to perform effortlessly while you struggle just to be average. You are also overly modest about your strengths. What seems to be no big deal to you is difficult for others. Your strengths are stronger and your weaknesses weaker than you realize. You need help. You are also precisely the help someone else needs.
> 承认吧：你在某些事情上很糟糕。你有盲点、有弱项，有些领域别人似乎轻而易举，而你挣扎着才能做到中等。你对自己的长处也过于谦虚。对你来说无关痛痒的事对别人来说却很难。你的强项比你意识到的更强，你的弱项比你想象的更弱。你需要帮助。而你恰恰正是别人所需要的那种帮助。

Everyone knows the name Michael Eisner. He’s an icon - the former CEO of The Walt Disney Company who discovered untapped reserves of profitability in the Disney brand, made obscenely large sums of money, and then was driven from leadership when things went sour. Many books and articles have been written about him.
> 迈克尔·艾斯纳的名字人人皆知。他是一个偶像——这位迪士尼公司前首席执行官发掘了迪士尼品牌中未被开发的盈利潜力，赚取了天文数字的财富，但后来在局势恶化时被迫离开领导岗位。已有许多书籍和文章论述了他。

Yet frequently overlooked is the fact that Eisner’s greatest accomplishments were not his alone, while some of his greatest failures were. Eisner’s story is perhaps the
> 然而，人们常常忽视这样一个事实：艾斯纳的最大成就并非完全属于他本人，而他的一些重大失败却确实如此。艾斯纳的故事或许是

greatest corporate cautionary tale about the need for a partner with complementary strengths.
> 关于需要拥有互补优势的合伙人这一点的最具警示意义的企业案例。

Eisner was not sold to the Disney board of directors by himself. He could not have attained the position of CEO without Frank Wells, a Rhodes Scholar and former vice chairman of Warner Brothers. As the two men schemed in the early 1980s with Stanley Gold, who was Roy Disney’s attorney, on how to take control of the underperforming company, it became apparent neither executive would be appointed to lead the company alone.
> 艾斯纳并不是单独被迪士尼董事会推荐上位的。若无弗兰克·威尔斯——一位罗德学者、前华纳兄弟公司副董事长——他不可能担任首席执行官。在 20 世纪 80 年代初，他与罗伊·迪士尼的律师斯坦利·戈德密谋如何接管这家业绩不佳的公司时，显而易见两位高管都不会被单独任命来领导公司。

Eisner was president and chief operating officer of Paramount Pictures and a former senior vice president at ABC . He was considered one of the best executives in the entertainment business at finding money-making ideas. Wells, meanwhile, had a reputation for being urbane, considerate, and financially adroit.
> 艾斯纳曾任派拉蒙影业公司总裁兼首席运营官，并且是美国广播公司（ABC）的前高级副总裁。他被认为是娱乐圈中最擅长发现赚钱点子的一位高管。与此同时，维尔斯以彬彬有礼、体贴周到和精通财务著称。

Convincing Disney’s board to hire both men was not easy. One board member interviewed Eisner and Wells on consecutive days. The former emphasized his creativity and his belief that Disney was full of new opportunities; the latter emphasized his negotiation and business skills. “But we’re only looking for one CEO,” said the director. "Then get Eisner,"Wells said. “You need creativity more than anything else.” Other board members felt Disney needed Wells more than it needed Eisner.
> 说服迪士尼董事会同时雇用这两个人并不容易。有一位董事在连续两天分别面试了艾斯纳和维尔斯。前者强调自己的创造力以及他认为迪士尼充满新机遇的信念；后者则强调他的谈判和商业能力。“但我们只在找一位首席执行官，”那位董事说。“那就选艾斯纳，”维尔斯说。“你比任何东西都更需要创造力。”其他董事则觉得迪士尼比起艾斯纳更需要维尔斯。

Eventually, in September 1984, the Disney board voted unanimously to make Eisner chairman and chief
> 最终，在 1984 年 9 月，迪士尼董事会一致投票决定任命艾斯纳为董事长兼首席

executive and to make Wells president and chief operating officer. “From that point on,” wrote Eisner, “we began to sail around the world on the Disney adventure. If I was the rudder, he was the keel. For 10 years, we never had a fight or a disagreement, or even a misunderstanding.”
> 执行官，并任命维尔斯为总裁兼首席运营官。“从那时起，”艾斯纳写道，“我们开始在迪士尼的冒险中环游世界。如果我是舵，他就是龙骨。在那 10 年里，我们从未有过争吵、分歧，甚至误解。”

The two men quickly established a solid working relationship in which Wells’ business acumen rounded out Eisner’s creative impulses. Wells concentrated on administrative and financial issues; Eisner supervised films, television projects, and Disney’s theme parks. “Eisner and Wells,” as one account put it, “were like right and left arms, one creative, impulsive, irreverent; the other measured, practical, decisive.”
> 两人很快建立了牢固的工作关系，威尔斯的商业头脑补足了艾斯纳的创意冲动。威尔斯专注于行政和财务事务；艾斯纳则负责监督电影、电视项目和迪士尼的主题公园。正如有一篇报道所说，“艾斯纳和威尔斯就像左右手，一位富有创造力、冲动且无所顾忌；另一位审慎、务实且果断。”

The two new Disney executives faced a daunting list of problems. Attendance at Disneyland was down 17 percent from its peak in 1980. The number of visitors to Epcot was below projections. Disney’s live-action studio was not a major player. Its animated film operations were dying. Actor Tom Hanks commented that the headquarters in Burbank were like “a Greyhound bus station in the fifties.” While its sources of revenue were faltering, the company lumbered forward with nearly a billion dollars in debt.
> 这两位新任迪士尼高管面临着一长串令人生畏的问题。迪士尼乐园的入园人数比 1980 年的峰值下降了 17%。艾波卡特的游客人数低于预测。迪士尼的真人电影制片厂并非重要角色，其动画电影业务濒临衰亡。演员汤姆·汉克斯曾评论说，伯班克的总部像“1950 年代的灰狗长途汽车站”。在收入来源陷入困境的同时，公司背负着近十亿美元的债务，艰难前行。

The essence of the new executives’ strategy was moving money away from places where it gave little return and toward investments that might pay off. They terminated more than a thousand employees in the first year. They killed off questionable projects.
> 这两位高管策略的要点是把资金从回报甚微之处抽出，转向可能带来回报的投资。他们在第一年裁减了逾千名员工。终止了可疑的项目。

In the search for new revenue, no issue was more controversial among executives than whether to release Disney’s animated classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the company’s most treasured assets, on home video. Selling the videos would tap a vast market, but it could reduce the impact of recycling the movies back to theaters every 7 to 10 years. Mass marketing could cheapen the brand.
> 在寻求新收入的过程中，对高管们来说，没有哪个问题比是否将迪士尼的动画经典（如《白雪公主和七个小矮人》这样公司最珍贵的资产）发行家庭录像更具争议。出售录像带可以开拓一个庞大的市场，但可能会削弱每 7 到 10 年将电影重新上映到影院的影响力。大规模营销可能会降低品牌的价值。

Wells and Eisner convened a series of marathon meetings to discuss the issue. Roy Disney opposed the idea. “There are overwhelming arguments not to do this,” Wells said, “but it’s still important to have the debate.”
> 威尔斯和艾斯纳召集了一系列马拉松式会议来讨论这一问题。罗伊·迪士尼反对这一想法。威尔斯说：“有压倒性的理由不这么做，但进行辩论仍然很重要。”

Arguing such issues brought out Wells’ strengths for finding the best course. “We were a remarkably complementary fit,” said Eisner. “Frank was brilliant at putting all the evidence on the table, but he often found it hard to make the final decision. I never tried to come to a conclusion by logically weighing the pros and cons. Instead, with Frank’s help, I kept accumulating evidence
> 争论这些问题凸显了威尔斯在找出最佳方案方面的长处。“我们非常互补，”艾斯纳说。“弗兰克非常擅长把所有证据摆到桌面上，但他常常难以做出最终决定。我从不试图通过逻辑权衡利弊来得出结论。相反，在弗兰克的帮助下，我不断收集证据

until I reached the point where a certain choice instinctively felt right.” The eventual decision to release movies such as Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella successfully tapped a new vein of revenue for the company, and the home video market became a staple of the company’s finances.
> 直到达到某个选择凭直觉感觉正确的程度。” 最终决定发行《木偶奇遇记》《睡美人》和《灰姑娘》等电影，成功为公司开辟了新的收入来源，家庭录像市场也成为公司财务的支柱。

Wells not only helped refine the business strategy, he also kept the peace. Eisner rubbed people the wrong way. He fussed over the details of new rides. He was suspicious of others’ motives, and he didn’t trust many people. He had a huge ego. He needed someone to balance him. Several executives remarked that Wells kept Eisner from getting out of control. “When we had a grievance list, going to Frank was like going to the Supreme Court,” said one executive. “You felt you got a fair hearing, and you felt you got justice.”
> 威尔斯不仅帮助完善了商业策略，他还起到了维持和气的作用。艾斯纳让人反感。他对新游乐设施的细节过分操心。他怀疑别人的动机，不信任很多人。他自负甚大。他需要有人来平衡他。几位高管指出，威尔斯让艾斯纳不至于失控。“当我们有申诉清单时，去找弗兰克就像去最高法院，”一位高管说。“你会觉得你得到了公正的聆讯，也觉得你得到了正义。”

“For Michael, I make life easier,” Wells told Fortune in 1991. “For me, he makes life more fun.”
> “为了迈克尔，我让生活更容易，”威尔斯在 1991 年对《财富》说。“对我来说，他让生活更有趣。”

During Easter weekend of 1994, Wells organized a skiing excursion in the mountains east of Elko, Nevada.
> 1994 年复活节周末，韦尔斯在内华达州埃尔科以东的山脉组织了一次滑雪远足。

On the second day of the outing, Wells was among the passengers traveling in a helicopter when its engine flamed out and it dropped from the sky. He was killed on impact.
> 在这次出行的第二天，韦尔斯乘坐的一架直升机在飞行中发动机熄火并坠落，他在坠落中当场身亡。

Eisner personally worked on the press release issued by the company. “Frank Wells has been the purest definition of a life force I have ever known,” it said. “His wisdom, his charm, his zest for experience and challenge . . . his naked and awesome intelligence …set him apart and beyond. The world has lost a great human being.”
> 艾斯纳亲自起草了公司发布的新闻稿。“弗兰克·韦尔斯是我所知的生命力最纯粹的定义，”新闻稿写道。“他的智慧、风度、对体验和挑战的热情……他那裸露而令人敬畏的智力……使他卓然独立。世界失去了一位伟大的人。”

Rather than seek a new business partner, Eisner lobbied for and received approval to assume Wells’ responsibilities and titles himself. “In part, the purpose was to send an immediate signal to Wall Street and the financial community that business at Disney would continue as usual,” the now Chairman-CEO-COO-president wrote in the late 1990s. “Equally important, I wanted to put to rest speculation that anyone was in line to inherit Frank’s job.”
> 艾斯纳并未寻求新的商业伙伴，而是游说并获得批准，亲自接任韦尔斯的职责和头衔。“部分原因是要向华尔街和金融界立即发出信号，表明迪士尼的业务将照常进行，”这位后来的董事长兼首席执行官兼首席运营官兼总裁在 20 世纪 90 年代末写道。“同样重要的是，我想平息关于有人会继承弗兰克职位的猜测。”

After the financial success Eisner and Wells led for a decade, the Disney board apparently forgot why it installed the two of them together in 1984. Business could not “continue as usual” because Eisner was only part of the equation. If the power of their complementary abilities was not fully evident during the partnership, it was doubly apparent after the accident.
> 在艾斯纳和韦尔斯领导的十年财务成功之后，迪士尼董事会显然忘记了当初为何在 1984 年将两人一起安插进来。生意不可能“照旧进行”，因为艾斯纳只是方程式的一部分。如果在他们的合作期间，两人互补能力的力量还没有完全显现，那么在事故之后这一点就更加明显了。

Without Wells, a book the men had planned to write together emerged instead as Eisner’s vain, sanitized autobiography. It landed with a thud. “His descriptions can be so calculatingly self-serving that they lack both credibility

Eventually, Eisner lost the backing of his original sponsors. Stanley Gold and Roy Disney, who recruited Wells and Eisner as a team to boost the value of the company, finally determined Eisner by himself was at the center of the stock’s decline. “No one ignores Michael’s successes from 1984 to 1994,” they wrote in a letter to the board of directors during the 2004 fight for control of the company. “The problem is, following the death of Frank Wells in 1994, the company’s performance has been substandard. How long can Michael Eisner live on the company’s accomplishments from 1984 to 1994?”
> 最终，艾斯纳失去了最初支持者的支持。史丹利·戈德和罗伊·迪士尼曾把威尔斯和艾斯纳作为一个团队招募进来以提升公司的价值，但他们最终断定，光是艾斯纳一人是导致股价下跌的根源。在 2004 年争夺公司控制权期间，他们在写给董事会的一封信中写道：“没人会忽视迈克尔在 1984 到 1994 年间取得的成功。问题是，自 1994 年弗兰克·威尔斯去世后，公司业绩一直未达标。迈克尔·艾斯纳还能靠 1984 到 1994 年间公司的成就过多久？”

The question was answered in March 2004, when an unprecedented 43 percent of shareholders withheld their votes to re-elect Eisner to the board. Within a year-and-a-half, he was unemployed. After Eisner, Disney’s board chose to separate the positions of CEO and chairman, making sure the company is led by two people, not one.

In the late 1990s, a group of researchers from two universities and the U.S. Naval Warfare Center recruited 112 young men and women and paired them randomly to see how well each partnership could fly a combat mission in an F-16 flight simulator. All the “pilots” were given a 45 -minute hands-on training session. For each pair, one of the volunteers flew the plane. The other gathered information, set airspeed, and called up different weapons systems. Both could fire the weapons.
> 在 20 世纪 90 年代末，两所大学和美国海军战争中心的一组研究人员招募了 112 名男女青年，并将他们随机配对，观察每对搭档在 F-16 飞行模拟器中执行战斗任务的表现。所有“飞行员”都接受了 45 分钟的实操训练。每对中，一名志愿者驾驶飞机，另一名收集信息、设置空速并调出不同的武器系统。双方都可以开火。

The pairs received conflicting objectives that forced them to make difficult choices. They were told to survive enemy fire, fly a predetermined route that covered four destination markers called “waypoints,” and shoot down enemy aircraft. “This scoring scheme presented a strategic dilemma for teams, as the three objectives were incompatible,” wrote
> 这些搭档收到相互冲突的目标，迫使他们做出艰难的选择。他们被告知要在敌方炮火下生存，按预定航线飞行，经过称为“航路点”的四个目的地标记，并击落敌机。“这种计分方案为团队提出了战略困境，因为这三个目标彼此不兼容，”写道

the researchers. “For example, flying directly toward all waypoints placed the team in great risk and left little time for fighting enemy planes. Alternatively, actively engaging enemy planes left little time for reaching waypoints.” There was no way to get to all the waypoints without encountering enemy aircraft because that was where the enemy planes were typically circling.
> 研究人员说：“例如，直接朝所有航路点飞去会让小组面临极大危险，并且几乎没有时间与敌机交战。相反，积极迎战敌机又几乎没有时间到达航路点。” 无法在不遇到敌机的情况下到达所有航路点，因为敌机通常就在那些地方盘旋。

Going into the test, the pairs displayed differing levels of what the researchers called a “shared mental model” of the challenge. The scientists were curious to know not just how well each pair coordinated in completing the mission, but how well they cooperated, how well they assumed their separate roles, how much they liked the activity, and the intensity of their “team spirit.”
> 在测试开始时，各对成员在研究人员所称的“共享心理模型”方面表现出不同程度的差异。科学家们不仅想知道每对在完成任务时协调得有多好，还想了解他们合作得如何、各自承担角色的情况、对该活动的喜好程度以及他们“团队精神”的强度。

Each pair flew six missions that took about 10 minutes. While the duos’ performance improved with practice, those who were more “in sync” at the beginning continued to stay better focused through the missions. Partners who shared a similar view of the challenge did better than the other pairs throughout the experiment. Working together well, the scientists concluded, requires a common view of the mission “above and beyond simple shared task knowledge.”
> 每对搭档进行了六次任务飞行，每次大约十分钟。虽然随着练习二人的表现有所提升，但那些一开始就更“同步”的搭档在整个任务中依然保持着更好的专注度。对挑战持相似看法的搭档在整个实验中表现优于其他组合。科学家们得出结论：良好协作需要一种对任务的共同认知，“这超越了简单的共同任务知识”。

What is true for flying a simulated combat assignment applies to all of your collaborative endeavors. A common mission is the foundation for all partnerships.
> 对模拟战斗任务适用的道理同样适用于你所有的协作努力。共同的使命是一切伙伴关系的基础。

Collaboration is more than friendship or collegiality, more than being in the same office or working for the same firm, more than proximity or mutual appreciation.
> 协作不仅仅是友谊或同事情谊，不仅仅是身处同一办公室或为同一家公司工作，也不仅仅是地理接近或相互欣赏。

It occurs only when you and an ally strive for a definitive accomplishment - passing work between yourselves, “putting your heads together,” or doubling up on a task neither of you could accomplish alone. For this reason, the relationship is unique. It exists to serve the goal. It lasts only until the mission is accomplished. Once the objective is reached, the partnership must adopt a new goal or it dissolves.
> 只有当你和盟友为了一个明确的成就而努力时，协作才会发生——在你们之间传递工作、“集思广益”，或两人合力完成任何一方独自无法完成的任务。因此，这种关系是独特的。它存在是为了服务于目标。它仅在任务完成之前持续。一旦目标达成，伙伴关系要么采纳一个新目标，要么解散。

Although a strong friendship often emerges from collaboration, the partnership itself ends once there is no longer a shared, uncompleted objective facing the two people. Coauthors are partners until their book is finished. Astronauts are confederates only until the space mission returns to Earth. It’s the active, unresolved case that makes partners of two fellow prosecutors.
> 尽管牢固的友谊常常由合作中产生，但一旦两人不再面临共同且未完成的目标，伙伴关系本身也就结束。合著者在他们的书完成之前是伙伴。宇航员只有在太空任务返回地球之前才是同盟。正是正在进行且未解决的事务，使两位同为检察官的人结成伙伴关系。

Three statements from the Gallup research proved to be best at assessing the degree to which both people in a partnership are pursuing the same objective:
> 盖洛普研究中有三项陈述被证明最能评估一段伙伴关系中双方在多大程度上在追求同一目标：

We share a common goal.
> 我们有共同的目标。

We have a common purpose for what we do.
> 我们对所做的事情有共同的目的。

We believe in the same mission in life.
> 我们相信人生的使命相同。

The thresholds are just as high on the common mission element as they are for the statements that apply to complementary strengths. Here too, respondents were asked to rate their agreement with each of these statements from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”). To be categorized as reaching a “good” level on having a common

mission, respondents must average at least 3.6 on the three statements above. To be “exceptional,” they must strongly agree to each one.
> 使命方面达到“良好”水平，受访者在以上三条陈述上的平均分必须至少为 3.6。要被评为“卓越”，他们必须对每一条都表示强烈同意。

“As a teacher, I collaborate whenever possible,” one woman said. “A colleague and I infused music into the U.S. history curriculum by spending a summer going to obscure libraries and listening to songs that reflected various events. We then created activities that went with each song. This partnership was so successful because we shared a common vision and we were working together on it from start to finish.”
> “作为一名教师，我尽可能与人合作，”一位女士说。“我和一位同事在暑假里到一些鲜为人知的图书馆去，听那些反映各种事件的歌曲，从而将音乐融入美国历史课程。然后我们为每首歌设计了相应的活动。这个合作之所以如此成功，是因为我们有共同的愿景，并且从头到尾一起投入工作。”

Although a shared mission is essential, maybe even obvious, the lack of this basic concurrence is where many pairs fail. Only one in four people in poor partnerships agree they have a common goal or purpose with the other person. In many cases, both think they are on the same page, but when limits of time, money, or attention force difficult choices, it becomes clear the two have conflicting priorities. Only 9 percent of those in poor partnerships say they were “very successful” at reaching their goal. It’s difficult to do if you’re not aiming at the same target.
> 尽管共同的使命至关重要，甚至显而易见，许多搭档失败的原因正是缺乏这种基本的一致。在糟糕的合作关系中，只有四分之一的人认为自己与对方有共同的目标或目的。在许多情况下，双方都以为彼此想法一致，但当时间、金钱或注意力的限制迫使做出艰难选择时，就会显现出双方优先事项的冲突。只有 9%的糟糕合作关系中的人表示他们在实现目标方面“非常成功”。如果你们的目标不一致，要做到这一点是很困难的。

Your primary qualification to participate in a partnership is your ability to help fulfill the mission the two of you share. The same is true of your counterpart. Therefore, the person you select as a collaborator is likely to be different than someone you would choose as a friend, date, neighbor, or roommate. However much you may like someone, think highly of his abilities, or admire her determination, you
> 你参与合作关系的主要资格是你能否帮助实现你们共同的使命。你的合作伙伴也同样需要具备这一点。因此，你选择的合作者很可能会不同于你会选择作为朋友、约会对象、邻居或室友的人。无论你多么喜欢某个人，多么看重他/她的能力，或多么佩服她的决心，你

would be foolish to embark on a partnership unless both of you agree on the objective and bring something unique to its achievement.
> 如果双方在目标上无法达成一致并且各自不能为实现该目标带来独特贡献，那么开始一段合作关系将是愚蠢的。

Partnerships produce something more than just the happiness of the two participants. Two college roommates are not collaborators; two classmates working together on a paper for a shared grade are. Next-door neighbors are not partners, but they are if they team up to argue against their city’s plan to extend the road on which they live. Two mothers of elementary-school-aged girls may be on cordial terms, but they are not a team until they volunteer to lead their daughters’ Girl Scout troop.
> 伙伴关系所带来的，不仅仅是两名参与者的快乐。两个大学室友并非合作者；而为了共同的成绩一起合作完成一篇论文的两名同学，则是。隔壁邻居并不是伙伴，但如果他们联手反对市政扩大道路的计划，那他们就是伙伴。两个有着小学生女儿的母亲之间或许相处融洽，但只有当她们自愿承担起带领女儿们的童子军队伍的职责时，才算是一个团队。

Without a shared mission, partnerships inevitably break into two individual pursuits. With a common goal, two people who might otherwise knock heads subordinate their personal concerns for the sake of the accomplishment.
> 没有共同的使命，伙伴关系不可避免地会分裂成各自为政的两种追求。有了共同的目标，本来可能针锋相对的两个人会为了达成目标而将个人顾虑置于次要地位。

At 27,900 Feet above sea level, Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary were left alone to attempt the summit of Everest.
> 在海拔 27,900 英尺处，丹增·诺尔盖和埃德蒙·希拉里被单独留下去尝试登顶珠穆朗玛峰。

There were others with them earlier in the climb, carrying gear and oxygen bottles and cutting steps in the ice and snow. It took three months for the British expedition and their hired Sherpas to get the two men to Camp Nine. Then, on the afternoon of May 28, 1953, the support team descended, leaving Tenzing and Hillary just enough oxygen, food, and equipment to give them a chance at reaching the top.
> 在攀登的早期还有其他人陪同，搬运装备和氧气瓶，在冰雪中凿阶。英方探险队与他们雇佣的夏尔巴人花了三个月时间把两人送到第九营地。然后，在 1953 年 5 月 28 日下午，后援队下撤，留下给丹增和希拉里的氧气、食物和装备仅够给他们争取一次登顶的机会。

“Tenzing and I watched them go, and I felt an intense feeling of loneliness as they slowly clambered down the mountain-side, leaving us on our little ledge,” wrote Hillary. Whether the two men succeeded, and whether they survived, depended on how well they worked together on their common goal.
> “丹增和我看着他们离去，当他们慢慢攀下山坡，留下我们在那小小的岩脊上时，我感到一种强烈的孤独感，”希拉里写道。两人是否能成功，是否能活着回来，取决于他们在共同目标上合作的程度。

The partnership was not perfect. Tenzing would have preferred to climb with Swiss mountaineer Raymond Lambert, with whom he nearly reached the summit exactly a year before and whose red scarf he wore on this climb. But Nepal issued its single climbing permit in 1953 to the British, not the Swiss. (Even though Hillary was from New Zealand, he had been on previous British climbs and was invited to join the 1953 climb.) Hillary would have chosen George Lowe, one of the three men who had just descended, but expedition leader John Hunt would not allow it. “We had the rather sneaking feeling that John didn’t really want two New Zealanders to stand on the top of Mt. Everest,” said Hillary. Forced to find a new counterpart, Hillary teamed up with the respected Sherpa.
> 这对搭档并不完美。丹增本想与瑞士登山家雷蒙德·兰伯特一同攀登——正是一年前他与兰伯特差点登顶，而且此次攀登他还戴着兰伯特的红围巾。但尼泊尔在 1953 年将唯一的登山许可发给了英国人，而不是瑞士人。（尽管希拉里来自新西兰，他曾参加过此前的英国登山活动并被邀请加入 1953 年的攀登。）希拉里本来会选择乔治·洛威——三名刚下山者之一，但远征队领队约翰·亨特不允许。“我们多少有点偷偷觉得约翰并不真的想让两个新西兰人在珠穆朗玛峰顶上站着，”希拉里说。被迫另寻搭档，希拉里与这位受人尊敬的夏尔巴结成了队伍。

Yet these disappointments paled in comparison to Tenzing’s and Hillary’s dedication to reaching the highest point on Earth. To stand on the summit, both were willing to suffer the trials of high altitude, to risk their lives, and to relegate their selfish concerns. “I have always hated small bickerings and resentments while one is engaged on a great adventure,” wrote Tenzing. “When people are going to a mountain they should forget the molehills. When they are
> 然而，这些失望与丹增和希拉里的决心相比显得微不足道。为了到达地球的最高点，二人愿意忍受高海拔的磨难，冒着生命危险，并把自私的顾虑放在一边。丹增写道：“在从事伟大冒险时，我一直讨厌小小的争吵和怨恨。人们既然要去征服一座高山，就应当忘记那些小事。当他们要去——”

involved in a big thing they should have big hearts to go with it.”
> 既然要参与大事，就应该有与之相匹配的宽广胸怀。

Although there are, of course, endeavors that can be accomplished alone, in 1953, conquering Mt. Everest wasn’t one of them. Two men were better than one. One man worked on the oxygen equipment while the other fired up the stove for meals and the hot, sugary lemonade that provided energy and fought off dehydration. Two people needed to set up the tent in the blasts of Himalayan wind. When working their way up the mountain, the men took turns leading, allowing the trailing climber an easier go of it.
> 虽然当然有些事情可以独自完成，但在 1953 年，征服珠穆朗玛峰并不是其中之一。两个人总比一个人强。一个人负责调试供氧设备，另一个则生火做饭和准备那杯提供能量并抵抗脱水的热甜柠檬水。两个需要在喜马拉雅山的强风中搭好帐篷。攀登山峰时，队员轮流领攀，让落在后面的登山者更轻松一些。

The most important advantage two climbers have over one is the ability to rope themselves together and spread out. In precarious spots, only one ventures forward. The other secures himself and the rope in case the leading man falls. The technique is called a belay.
> 两名登山者相比单独一人的最重要优势是能够把绳子系在一起并分开行动。在危险的地段，通常只有一人向前探进。另一人固定自己并控制绳子，以防先行者坠落。这种技术称为保护（belay）。

Belaying had already saved Hillary’s life earlier in the expedition. He was in the lead as they navigated between towers of ice in the treacherous Khumbu Icefall. Without warning, the snow under Hillary’s feet gave way, and he slid into a crevasse. “Tenzing! Tenzing!” he shouted. Tenzing jammed his ax into the snow and threw himself next to it as the rope unraveled and jerked taut between them. “Fortunately there was not too much rope between us, and I was prepared,” said the Sherpa. "I was able to stop his fall after about 15 feet and then, with slow pulling and hauling, managed to pull him up again. By the time he was out of the crevasse my
> 保护在探险中早已救过希拉里的命。他在前头，引路穿过危险的昆布冰瀑群之间的冰塔。毫无预兆，希拉里的脚下雪地塌陷，他滑入了一个裂缝。“丹增！丹增！”他喊道。丹增把冰镐楔入雪中，扑向它的同时绳子在他们之间解开又绷紧。“幸运的是我们之间的绳子不太多，而且我有准备，”这位夏尔巴说。“我能在他坠落约十五英尺后将其阻住，然后慢慢拉、慢慢拽，设法把他拖了上来。到他爬出裂缝时我的

gloves were torn from the strain; but my hands were all right, and except for a few bruises Hillary was unhurt."
> 手套已因拉扯而被撕破；但我的手还好，除了几处青肿希拉里并无大碍。”

Mountaineers consider themselves one entity moving toward the summit - one “rope” - when tied together and climbing. Discussing similar falls when he was tied to Lowe, Hillary told an interviewer: “You could say he was saving my life every time, but we don’t think of it in those terms. We were a team; someone had to go down first. And someone had to be second to make sure they didn’t go to the bottom.”
> 登山者在系在一起攀登时，认为自己是朝顶峰移动的一个整体——一条“绳子”。在谈到与洛伊系在一起时发生的类似坠落，希拉里对一位采访者说：“你可以说他每次都在救我的命，但我们并不这么想。我们是一个队；必须有人先落下。也必须有人第二个下去，以确保他们不会掉到谷底。”

In 1953, no one knew for sure whether humans could reach the summit without succumbing to deadly highaltitude illnesses. Above 26,000 feet, there is so little oxygen in the air that a person can live only for a few days. George Mallory and his companion, Andrew Irvine, died near the top in 1924. Numerous attempts in the 1930s and 1940s ended in failure.
> 在 1953 年，没有人确定人类是否能在不死于致命高海拔疾病的情况下到达顶峰。在 26000 英尺以上，空气中的氧气极少，一个人只能活几天。乔治·马洛里和他的同伴安德鲁·欧文在 1924 年接近顶峰时死亡。1930 年代和 1940 年代的多次尝试都以失败告终。

Hillary and Tenzing spent a difficult night at Camp Nine in hopes that sleeping at the higher altitude would put them within reach of the summit on the next day. “Everything took five times as long as it would have in a place where there was enough air to breathe,” wrote Tenzing. They alternated between using bottled oxygen to allow them to sleep and waking to drink more lemonade. They awakened for good before 4 a.m. on the morning of May 29. The temperature was -25 degrees Celsius.
> 希拉里和丹增在第九营地度过了一个艰难的夜晚，希望在更高的海拔睡觉能让他们第二天触及峰顶。丹增写道：“在空气足以呼吸的地方，所有事情所需的时间都会是这里的五分之一。”他们交替使用瓶装氧气以便入睡，并醒来喝更多柠檬水。5 月 29 日清晨四点前他们彻底醒来。气温为摄氏-25 度。

Emerging three hours later, Tenzing took the lead while Hillary’s feet warmed inside his boots, which had frozen overnight. “Always willing to do his share, and more than his
> 三小时后出来，丹增领先，而希拉里的脚在他的靴子里暖和过来，那靴子一夜之间已经冻住。新西兰人回忆说：“丹增总是愿意做他应该做的，必要时甚至做得更多，他从我身边攀过，扑上斜坡。”

share if necessary, Tenzing scrambled past me and tackled the slope,” recalled the New Zealander. When Hillary’s feet began to warm, they reversed places, sharing the work of kicking steps into the snow.
> 当希拉里的脚开始暖和时，他们互换位置，共同承担在雪中踢踏出台阶的工作。

The pair soon faced a choice: They could either proceed along a ridge or take a snow slope to its left. Hillary decided the slope was safer. “We were climbing up an almost vertical white wall,” wrote Tenzing. “The worst part of it was that the snow was not firm, but kept sliding down, sliding down - and we with it - until I thought, 'Next time it will keep sliding, and we will go all the way to the bottom of the mountain.”
> 这对搭档很快面临选择：他们可以沿着一条山脊前进，或者走左侧的雪坡。希拉里觉得雪坡更安全。丹增写道：“我们正沿着几乎垂直的白色墙面攀登。最糟的是雪不结实，不断下滑、下滑——我们也随之滑下——直到我想，‘下一次雪继续滑，我们就会一直滑到山脚下。’”

Through the most difficult slopes, the two men changed the lead more frequently, picking their way higher until they found snow that provided safe belays. At one point, they found themselves facing snow cornices on the right hanging over a 10,000-foot drop and a precipice on the left overhanging an 8,000-foot fall. “It looks a fair cow, all right, as we’d say in New Zealand,” Hillary recalled.
> 在最难的雪坡上，两人更频繁地换位领攀，小心翼翼地向上寻找能提供安全保护的积雪。在某一处，他们面前是右侧悬垂着、下方有一万英尺深渊的雪脊，左侧则是悬垂着、下方有八千英尺断崖的悬崖。“看起来相当危险，确实如此，就像我们在新西兰会说的那样，”希拉里回忆道。

“If we were to get to the top,” wrote his partner, “it would have to be along a narrow, twisting line between precipice and cornices: never too far to the left, never too far to the right - or it would be the end of us.”
> “如果我们要到达顶峰，”他的伙伴写道，“就必须沿着一条狭窄而曲折的路线行进，夹在悬崖和雪脊之间：不能太靠左，也不能太靠右——否则我们就完了。”

Having navigated the ridgeline, they took turns, each belaying the other as he wedged himself into “a kind of chimney” created by snow on one side and rock on the other. The exertion left each man “panting like a gaffed fish.”
> 他们穿过山脊后轮流前进，互相保护着对方，一个人把自己楔进一侧是雪一侧是岩石形成的“某种烟囱”里。体力消耗使得每个人都“像被钩住的鱼一样喘不过气来”。

The angle was no longer as steep. The terrain appeared safe enough that the two men could walk together rather than taking turns. Uncertain about whether the snow would break off from the right, the climbers worked through a slope of snow on the left over a series of seemingly endless snow humps, each concealing the next.
> 坡度不再那么陡了。地形看起来足够安全，两人可以并肩而行，不必再轮换。对右侧的雪是否会断裂心存疑虑，登山者沿着左侧的雪坡前进，穿过一连串看似无尽的雪包，每个雪包都掩藏着下一个。

“Suddenly I realize that the ridge ahead doesn’t slope up, but down. I look quickly to my right,” recalled Hillary. “There, just above me, is a softly rounded, snow-covered little bump about as big as a haystack. The summit.” He turned to see his companion grinning through his oxygen mask. “I held out my hand, and in silence we shook in good Anglo-Saxon fashion. But this was not enough for Tenzing.”
> “突然我意识到前方的山脊不是向上倾斜，而是向下。我迅速向右看去，”希拉里回忆道。“就在我上方，有一个柔和圆润、被雪覆盖的小丘，大约有一堆干草那么大。那就是顶峰。”他转身看到同伴透过氧气面罩咧嘴笑着。“我伸出手，我们默默地按英格鲁-撒克逊的方式握了手。但这对丹增来说还不够。”

“This was not enough for Everest,” recalled Tenzing. “I waved my arms in the air and then threw them around Hillary, and we thumped each other on the back until, even with the oxygen, we were almost breathless.”
> “这对珠穆朗玛来说也不够，”丹增回忆道。“我在空中挥动双臂，然后把手臂搂在希拉里身上，我们相互拍打着背，直到连氧气也几乎让我们喘不过气来。”

In the media frenzy that followed the men’s accomplishment, reporters badgered the pair to know which of them reached the summit first. “All over the world I am asked, ‘Who got there first? Who got there first?’ Mountaineers understand that there is no sense to such a question,” wrote Tenzing, “that when two men are on the same rope they are together, and that is all there is to it.”
> 在随之而来的媒体狂潮中，记者们纠缠着要知道他们俩中谁先到达了山顶。“全世界都在问我，‘谁先到的？谁先到的？’”丹增写道，“登山者明白这样的问题毫无意义，两个同在一条绳上的人就是在一起，仅此而已。”

“All the way up and all the way down we helped, and were helped by, each other - and that was the way it should

Although you and your collaborator must agree on your mission, you don’t need to have the same reasons for pursuing it. Successful partners often have different motivations for making the climb. This usually does not hinder the alliance, particularly if both of you understand the driving force motivating the other and work to see those hopes fulfilled.

Motivations are often unique and deeply personal things, which complicates the issue of agreeing on the goal.

You must also be careful not to assume that because you and someone else have collaborated well in the past, you will do so in the future. Collaborating with the same person can be a dramatically different experience depending on the degree to which both of you are working for the same end.

John Adams and Thomas Jefferson fell into this trap. As delegates to the Continental Congress, the two men were assigned to draft the Declaration of Independence for the young United States. Because they shared the same goal, they worked out their differences. They quibbled, most notably about which of them should do the writing, but they did so constructively. Jefferson wrote the document; Adams defended it before the Congress. Each made small sacrifices for the sake of the goal. Their common mission united them.

But this time, they had divergent views about how the new country should be run. Although Adams briefly put forward the idea of integrating Jefferson into his administration, nothing came of it. Although Jefferson wrote a heartfelt letter that may have bridged their partisan divide, he never sent it. Without a shared goal, neither made enough of the concessions that united them in their earlier work.

Jefferson recalled the day when it was clear their working relationship ended. On a Monday evening in March 1797, the two men had dinner with George Washington and happened to leave at the same time. Walking together, they had a brief discussion about whether to send James Madison - a member of Jefferson’s party - to France, a friendly gesture by Adams that came to nothing because the Federalists disapproved and Madison declined. Adams withdrew the offer. “We came to Fifth Street,” wrote Jefferson, “where our road separated, his being down Market Street, mine off along Fifth, and we took leave; and he never after that said one word to me on the subject, or ever consulted me as to any measures of the government.” The president and his vice president went their separate ways that night and didn’t collaborate

The need for parallel aims is no less true for small projects than for those that make history. “My partner and I planned to complete a nature trail in the woods,” said one man Gallup interviewed. “We thought we understood what needed to be done,” he said, but they ultimately became discouraged and stopped working on the trail “because we did not see the big picture and the end goal clearly enough.”
> 对小项目和那些载入史册的项目一样，目标并行的必要性同样重要。“我和我的合伙人计划在树林里完成一条自然步道，”盖洛普采访的一位男子说。“我们以为自己理解需要做什么，”他说，但他们最终灰心丧气，停止了步道的建设，“因为我们没有足够清晰地看到大局和最终目标。”

Another respondent complained her counterpart lacked the same intensity she had for a new electronic reporting system designed to save their company millions of dollars. “My partner could not visualize the importance of our task or was focused on other objectives,” she said. Consequently, the project failed. “The difference in this partnership compared with successful ones I’ve had would be that I saw this as a cost saver for a billion-dollar operation, and she saw it as an unnecessary task.”
> 另一位受访者抱怨她的搭档对一套旨在为公司节省数百万美元的新电子报告系统没有她那样的投入强度。“我的合伙人无法想象我们任务的重要性，或者她把注意力放在其他目标上，”她说。因此，该项目失败了。“与我以前成功的合作相比，这次的不同在于我把这看作是一个为十亿美元规模企业节省成本的项目，而她却把它看作是不必要的任务。”

How can two people be successful working together if they don’t move toward the same objective? How can a canoe be paddled in two directions at once? While a shared goal alone is not enough to create a functional pair, without it, the two people are working at cross-purposes. A common mission unites disparate but complementary personalities. It elevates a working relationship above an arms-length negotiation, peaceful coexistence, or outright antagonism.
> 如果两个人朝着不同的目标行动，他们如何能在合作中取得成功？独木难撑双桨，怎么能同时向两个方向划桨？仅有共同目标并不足以创造一个功能性的搭档关系，但没有共同目标，两个人就是在相互对立。共同的使命能将不同却互补的个性联合起来。它把工作关系提升到超越肢体距离的谈判、和平共处或公然对抗的层面。

“I serve on the board of directors of my subdivision with a guy who is about 15 years older than me,” said one man.
> “我在我所在小区的董事会任职，和一个比我大大约十五岁的人一起工作，”一位男士说。

“We have very different management styles, and we often clash very hard when working on the board. However, last summer we were in agreement on whether our subdivision should be part of the city. We worked long and hard, gathering petitions from our neighbors about the ‘cityhood’ issue. We agreed on the objective, and by and large, we agreed on the process to achieve it. On this project, it was easy to get along with him. While at times we really hate each other personally, somehow we can put it aside and start anew when another project begins.”
> “我们的管理风格非常不同，在董事会工作时经常激烈冲突。不过，去年夏天我们在是否让小区并入城市的问题上意见一致。我们长时间努力，四处收集邻居们关于‘建城’问题的请愿。我们在目标上达成一致，并且在很大程度上也同意实现目标的过程。在这个项目上，很容易与他相处。虽然有时候我们私下里确实很讨厌对方，但在另一个项目开始时，不知怎么地我们能把这些放下，从头再来。”

This level of agreement can make two people who would normally be adversaries into allies. Its absence can just as reliably generate friction and create failure between two people who otherwise seem to be natural friends.

> 索贾娜·特鲁斯（Sojourner Truth）和奥利芙·吉尔伯特（Olive Gilbert）痛恨奴隶制，并希望加速其消亡。但这还不够。

When the two women decided to work together on a book, they had substantially different ideas about the final volume. Because they lacked a shared focus, Truth and Gilbert created a collection of compromises, exchanges, and minor disagreements rather than the far more powerful book that could have been. Their story illustrates how even with the noblest intentions, lack of a common mission undercuts collaboration.
> 当两位妇女决定合作写一本书时，她们对成书的最终样子有着实质性的不同想法。因为缺乏共同的焦点，特鲁斯和吉尔伯特写出的是一系列折衷、互换和小规模分歧的集合，而非本可以成为的更有力量的著作。她们的故事说明，即便怀有最高尚的意图，缺乏共同的使命也会削弱合作。

Olive Gilbert was a white abolitionist who was just a few years younger than Truth. Both women knew antislavery newspaper editor William Lloyd Garrison. He may have been the person Gilbert described as “a friend who had resided for a time in the ‘Community,’ and who, after describing [Truth], and singing one of her hymns, wished that [I] might see her.”
> 奥利芙·吉尔伯特是一位白人废奴主义者，比特鲁斯稍年轻几岁。两人都认识反奴隶制报纸编辑威廉·劳埃德·加里森。吉尔伯特所描述的那位“曾在‘社区’居住过一段时间的朋友， 在描述[特鲁斯]并唱了一首她的圣歌之后，希望[我]能见到她”的人，很可能就是他。

Sometime after the failure of the Northampton Association, Truth bought a house and needed money to pay the mortgage. An itinerant preacher by this time, she also wanted to tell her life’s story, but she was illiterate. Gilbert could read and write, and she wanted to use Truth’s experiences to portray the horrors of slavery. At some point, they sat down to work on a book - the former slave telling her story, and the writer taking notes.
> 在北安普顿协会失败之后不久，特鲁斯买了一所房子，需要钱来支付按揭。此时她是个巡回布道者，也想讲述自己的人生故事，但她不识字。吉尔伯特会读会写，她希望利用特鲁斯的经历来描绘奴隶制的恐怖。某个时候，两人坐下来一起写书——前奴隶讲述她的故事，作者在旁记录。

Isabella was born about 1797 in Ulster County, New York. Her first master was a Dutch immigrant, and Dutch became the girl’s first language. Because of the selling of slave children from their parents and husbands from their wives, many of the most basic facts about Isabella’s family were unknown to her. She believed she was the second youngest of 10 or 12 children, but her older siblings were sold before she could remember. She

to a second master, and she remembered being auctioned along with a number of sheep. She spoke only Dutch, and her new owners spoke only English, so they struggled to communicate. When she failed to understand orders, her masters became angry, and at one point, they whipped her until she was deeply cut and badly bleeding. “And now,” Truth told Gilbert, “when I hear 'em tell of whipping women on the bare flesh, it makes my flesh crawl, and my very hair rise on my head! Oh! My God! What a way is this of treating human beings?”

Gilbert portrayed Truth as a strong and eloquent woman. Although it was customary at the time to render quotes from uneducated blacks in broken vernacular, Gilbert quoted her collaborator in standard English. “This decision makes a tremendous difference in the dignity of the portrait she drew,” wrote University of Massachusetts Professor Jean M. Humez.
> 吉尔伯特把特鲁斯描绘成一个坚强而雄辩的女性。尽管当时通常会把未经教育的黑人引述为破碎的口语，吉尔伯特却用标准英语引用了她的合作者。“这一决定对她所描绘肖像的尊严产生了巨大影响，”马萨诸塞大学的让·M·休梅兹教授写道。

In their conversations, Truth told Gilbert many terrible stories - how she lived in a dingy basement with a number of other slaves and how she was attracted to a slave named Robert from a neighboring property, but his master forbade him from visiting, “anxious that no one’s property but his own should be enhanced by the increase of his slaves.” She told the writer how her master broke his promise to free her a year before New York law required it, how she therefore

claimed her own freedom by leaving, and how she had to sue to regain her illegally sold son.
> 声称通过离开来自行获得自由，以及她如何不得不通过诉讼才能夺回被非法卖掉的儿子。

A religious tone permeated Truth’s stories, such as how she took the name Sojourner and felt prompted by God to travel on a religious mission east of New York. “What are you going east for?” asked one woman at whose house she was staying. She replied, “The Spirit calls me there, and I must go.”
> 宗教色彩贯穿了特鲁斯（Truth）的故事，比如她为何取名为 Sojourner，并觉得上帝促使她去纽约以东执行一项宗教使命。“你要往东去做什么？”她寄宿的一个女人问。她回答：“圣灵呼唤我去那里，我必须前往。”

Narrative of Sojourner Truth: A Northern Slave was first published by Garrison in 1850. It allowed Gilbert, who would otherwise be unknown today, to editorialize against slavery in a way she never could have alone. The publication of the book made Truth a prominent abolitionist and speaker. Her fame eventually gained her a meeting with President Abraham Lincoln. She confessed she had not heard of him until he was running for the presidency. Lincoln smiled and replied, “I had heard of you many times before that.”
> 《Sojourner Truth 的叙述：一位北方奴隶》最初由加里森（Garrison）于 1850 年出版。这使得本来可能今天无人知晓的吉尔伯特（Gilbert）能够以一种她单独无法做到的方式对奴隶制进行编注。该书的出版使特鲁斯成为一位杰出的废奴主义者和演说家。她坦言直到林肯竞选总统时她才听说过他。林肯微笑着回答：“在那之前我已多次听说过你。”

Yet for all that Narrative of Sojourner Truth accomplished, the book is much less than what it could have been. It leaves the reader confused as to whether it is meant to be a story of one unique woman or an indictment of slavery. The text jumps from Gilbert narrating, to Truth speaking, to Gilbert dismissing her coauthor’s perspective. Narrative is full of “internal strains,” concluded historian Nell Irvin Painter. Through most of it, “Gilbert the abolitionist is often at odds with Truth the autobiographer.”
> 尽管《索加纳·特鲁斯的自述》取得了诸多成就，但这本书仍远未达到它本可以达到的高度。读者会困惑，不知道它究竟是要讲述一个独特女性的故事，还是要控诉奴隶制。正文在吉尔伯特叙述、特鲁斯发言、以及吉尔伯特驳斥她合著者观点之间跳来跳去。历史学家内尔·欧文·佩因特得出结论说，《自述》充满了“内在张力”。在大部分篇幅里，“作为废奴主义者的吉尔伯特常常与作为自传作者的特鲁斯发生冲突。”

Their book is “marred by [Gilbert’s] tendency to interpolate her opinions into the text,” wrote history

professor Jeffrey C. Stewart. “Rather than let her subject speak without moralizing interjections, Gilbert seizes upon Sojourner’s life story as a vehicle for her own indictment of slave owners and their justifications for slavery.”
> “吉尔伯特并没有让她的主体在没有说教般插话的情况下自己发声，反而把索加纳的生平故事据为己用，作为她对奴隶主及其为奴隶制辩护的控诉工具。”

The women had “contrasting and often clashing agendas,” wrote Humez. The finished work “implies a process of strenuous contest and negotiation between the two women” that led to “contradiction and even incoherence” in some of the most important passages of the book. It is impossible to fault either woman for her goal. Yet while both were worthy objectives, they were not sufficiently aligned to make a single, cohesive volume.
> 休梅茨写道，两位女性“目标各异且常常冲突”。成书后的作品“暗含着两位女性之间经过激烈争执和协商的过程”，这导致本书一些最重要段落出现“矛盾乃至前后不连贯”。无论指责哪一位女性追求的目标都是不公的。然而，尽管两者都是值得追求的目标，但它们之间的对齐不足以形成一个统一、连贯的篇章。

Without intending to do so, Gilbert and Truth taught lessons beyond the horrors of slavery and the compelling nature of a spiritual journey. They also showed that no matter how talented you and your collaborator may be, how complementary the fit between you, or how laudable your individual intentions, if you cannot agree on a common mission, your partnership will ultimately fall short of its potential.
> 吉尔伯特与特鲁斯并非有意如此，但她们传授的教训超越了奴隶制的恐怖和精神旅程的强烈感染力。她们还表明，无论你和合作者多么有才华、彼此多么互补、个人意图多么可嘉，如果无法就共同使命达成一致，你们的伙伴关系最终都会未能发挥出应有的潜力。

Several years ago, a scientist at Emory University introduced female capuchin monkeys to money. She gave them granite pebbles and taught them that if they surrendered a rock back to her, she would trade it for a piece of cucumber. Capuchins like cucumbers, and if that were the only deal available, they would trade rocks for cucumber slices almost every time.
> 几年前，埃默里大学的一位科学家向雌性卷尾猴引入了货币概念。她给它们花岗岩小石子，并教它们如果把石子交还给她，她就会用一片黄瓜交换。卷尾猴喜欢黄瓜，如果只有这样的交易可选，它们几乎每次都会用石子换取黄瓜片。

The researcher then placed two monkeys in cages next to each other so they could see the bargain made by the capuchin next door. The primatologist approached one monkey and made the standard trade: a pebble for a piece of cucumber. Next, the scientist approached the second monkey and exchanged the pebble not for a cucumber slice, but for a grape. Capuchins like grapes more than they like cucumber slices.
> 随后，研究者把两只猴子分别放在并排的笼子里，让它们能看到隔壁猴子所得到的交易。灵长类动物学家走到一只猴子面前，进行了标准交易：一颗小石子换一片黄瓜。接着，科学家走向第二只猴子，把小石子换成的不是黄瓜片，而是一颗葡萄。卷尾猴比起黄瓜片更喜欢葡萄。

POWER OF 2

> 双人力量

Seeing another monkey get a better reward for the same action, the first capuchin often got upset. She might “go on strike,” refusing to make the exchange in future rounds. She might refuse to eat the cucumber piece even though she paid a pebble to acquire it, and if she hadn’t seen the grape trade, she would certainly have eaten it. In extreme cases, she might throw a small fit “such as tossing the token or reward out of the test chamber.”
> 看到另一只卷尾猴因同样的行为得到更好的奖励，第一只卷尾猴常常会不高兴。她可能会“罢工”，在之后的轮次中拒绝进行交换。她可能会拒绝吃那块黄瓜，即便她已经用石子换得了它；如果她没看到葡萄交易，她肯定会吃掉那块黄瓜。在极端情况下，她可能会大发脾气，“例如把代币或奖励扔出测试舱外”。

Behaving this way is irrational. The aggrieved monkey didn’t hurt anyone but herself by refusing to trade rocks for food or by throwing away cucumbers she otherwise would have eaten. So why did she do it?
> 这样的行为是不理性的。通过拒绝用石头换食物或把本来会吃掉的黄瓜扔掉，这只受委屈的猴子并没有伤害到别人，反而是损害了自己。那么她为什么要这样做呢？

“Capuchin monkeys,” wrote the authors of the study, “seem to measure reward in relative terms, comparing their own rewards with those available, and their own efforts with those of others. They respond negatively . . . if a partner gets a better deal.” Academics call this phenomenon “inequality aversion” or “distributive justice.” You might call it evenhandedness, doing right by the other person, or just plain fairness. If fairness is essential for a capuchin monkey, it must be more important and more basic to humans than we realize.
> “卷尾猴，”研究作者写道，“似乎以相对的方式衡量奖励，把自己的奖励与可得的奖励比较，把自己的付出与他人的付出比较。如果伙伴得到了更好的待遇，它们会作出负面反应……”。学术界把这种现象称为“对不平等的厌恶”或“分配正义”。你也许会称之为公平待人、对他人以公正之道，或仅仅叫做公平。如果公平对卷尾猴来说是必不可少的，那么对人类来说它必定比我们想象的更重要、更根本。

Gallup’s research did not involve cucumbers, grapes, or side-by-side enclosures, but similar discoveries emerged nonetheless in interviews with people comparing their best and worst partnerships. Several statements about fairness proved crucial for successful collaboration. We asked

We see each other as equals - one is not better than the other.
> 我们彼此视为平等——没有一方优于另一方。

Your partnership has little chance of succeeding unless both of you believe it is fair. On a scale from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”), it takes an average above 3.6 on these statements to reach the range considered “good.” Only respondents who strongly agree to all three statements have excellent alliances.
> 除非你们双方都认为这是公平的，否则你们的合作很难成功。在“1（非常不同意）”到“5（非常同意）”的评分中，这些陈述的平均分需要超过 3.6 才能进入被视为“良好”的范围。只有对这三条陈述全部表示非常同意的受访者，才拥有出色的伙伴关系。

Particularly at the beginning of a working relationship, colleagues cannot avoid making comparisons between their own rewards and those of their counterpart as they decide how earnestly to maintain the collaboration. Even if you have no formal authority over the pay, promotion, or recognition of your collaborator, you should make sure he gets a fair deal. If you are getting grapes, you have a responsibility to make sure your counterpart is getting something better than cucumbers.
> 尤其在工作关系刚开始时，同事们在决定以多大诚意维持合作时，难免会将自己的回报与对方的回报进行比较。即使你对合作者的薪酬、晋升或认可没有正式的权力，你也应该确保他得到公平的待遇。如果你拿到的是葡萄，你就有责任确保你的合作者得到比黄瓜更好的东西。

As logical as the need for fairness may be, feelings of being used are often at the heart of what destroys a working relationship. This is especially true when one of the two people has the ability to impose terms on the other. When Gallup asked people whether they and their manager share the workload fairly between them, the answers tilted dramatically toward the negative end of the scale. Nearly onethird strongly disagreed. Only 16 percent strongly agreed.

Without any knowledge of terms like “distributive justice” and “inequality aversion,” children quickly learn a series of conventions to maintain fairness. How should they split a piece of chocolate cake? One girl should cut it; the other gets to choose her half. Who gets to go first in a board game? Highest roll of the die starts. How do they choose teams for football? Two captains alternate drafting players. Who gets to ride in the front seat first? “Rock, paper, scissors - shoot!” Kids know the game will fall apart without these mechanisms. The offended player will announce, “That’s not fair!” take his marbles, and storm home.

There is no evidence that adults outgrow a desire for equity and fair play when they leave the classroom for the cubicle. Although they may paper over their reactions because of office politics, posturing, or waiting for the opportunity to even the score, everyone harbors an inner monkey. Adults may be less likely to whine, throw vegetables, or have a public meltdown, but their responses when asked about getting too much of the work or too little of the reward betray the same kinds of feelings.

“Our project required the viewing of hundreds of slides and creating lectures that would go with the slides,” one respondent told Gallup. “I found myself doing about 80 percent of the work. Since my evaluation was dependent on it, I felt I had to get it done even if I had to do most of the work myself. What it all comes down to is a sense of equity. If two people either work together or divide the work evenly, everything will be fine.” She was so frustrated by the experience that she could not write they had “worked together” without putting the phrase in quotes.
> “我们的项目需要观看数百张幻灯片并为这些幻灯片制作讲稿，”一位受访者告诉盖洛普。“我发现自己做了大约 80%的工作。由于我的评估取决于此，我觉得即使得自己承担大部分工作也必须把它完成。归根结底就是一种公平感。如果两个人要么共同工作，要么平均分配工作，一切都会好起来。”她对这段经历感到如此沮丧，以至于在写到他们“共同工作”时不得不把这个短语放在引号里。

In 1908, legendary explorer Ernest Shackleton and three other men on an Antarctic expedition - all four of them nearly starving - came upon a site where other expedition members had dropped three small pieces of chocolate and a piece of dog biscuit. Their established method for distributing food was for one man to turn his back while another pointed to a portion and asked, “Whose?” Because the man with his back turned could not see which portion he was assigning, the decisions were random - they were fair. This time, Shackleton got the piece of dog biscuit.

Although he was credited by all his men with incredible toughness and restraint, Shackleton confided in his journal his base motives just below the surface: “I was unlucky enough to get the bit of biscuit, and a curious unreasoning anger took possession of me for a moment at my bad luck. It shows how primitive we have become.”

eBay founder Pierre Omidyar made an important equitable gesture when he brought Jeff Skoll on board as his partner in 1996. The men needed to decide how to divide ownership in the new business. Skoll, a Stanford MBA, made involved calculations of the value of the company and the contributions of the two partners. “He had all sorts of analyses,” said the founder. Rather than strain at the details, they decided to use a simpler approach suggested by Omidyar. He estimated the work he performed before Skoll arrived to be worth 15 percent of the company’s value. They split the rest evenly.

The sense of internal justice, although difficult to delineate in complex real-life interactions, is nonetheless fundamental for effectively working together. It can be taken for granted when present, but its absence will destroy your shared work.

We adults usually aren’t as explicit, but research indicates we also disengage and retreat if we feel as if someone is taking advantage of us. Much as the monkeys will throw an apparently self-destructive fit to protest unfairness, people also do irrational things when others violate their sense of justice. In a partnership, it’s not what’s smart or what’s logical that matters, but what’s equitable. The emotional reactions of collaborators drive them toward interacting fairly or not interacting at all.

In August of 1937, two 24-year-old men sat down and wrote some notes about a business idea they had been discussing since their days together in college. At the top of the page, they wrote “Tentative organization plans and a tentative work program for a proposed business venture.” The men kicked around ideas for electronic devices the business could manufacture. Perhaps they should make some high-frequency receivers. “We should make every attempt to keep up on television,” they wrote to themselves. They planned to name their venture The Engineering Service Company.
> 1937 年 8 月，两个 24 岁的年轻人坐下来，写下一些关于他们自大学时代起就一直在讨论的一个商业想法的笔记。在页顶，他们写道：“拟议商业计划的暂定组织方案和暂定工作计划。”两人讨论了公司可以制造的电子设备想法。或许他们应该制造一些高频接收器。“我们应尽一切努力跟上电视的发展，”他们写给自己。他们计划将公司命名为工程服务公司（The Engineering Service Company）。

It wasn’t until two years later that the partners actually founded the enterprise. One of the men arranged for his recently married counterpart to rent the lower level of a house in Palo Alto, California, from an elderly woman who lived upstairs. The single guy moved into the small storage shed in the back. They made the house’s one-car garage into their production facility and began taking on what was at first an odd assortment of projects.
> 直到两年后，合伙人们才真正创办了这家企业。其中一个人安排刚结婚的搭档向住在楼上的一位老太太租下了加州帕洛阿尔托一栋房子的下层。单身的那位搬进了后院的小储物棚。他们把房子的一车位车库改成了生产车间，开始接手起初看起来零散的各种项目。

They designed and built a controller to adjust the tracking speed of the telescope at a nearby observatory. They invented a device to show when a bowler crossed the foul line at a neighborhood bowling alley. A local entrepreneur hired them to create a tone generator to tune harmonicas and an “exerciser” to artificially stimulate muscles. The entrepreneur “had an accommodating wife,”

wrote one of the collaborators, “and we spent one Sunday applying electrical currents of different frequencies to activate her leg muscles.”
> 一位合作者写道，“我们有一个星期天用不同频率的电流刺激她的腿部肌肉。”

As dubious as some of the first endeavors were, they brought in money and built the men’s confidence in themselves. “They also revealed something we hadn’t planned but that was of great benefit to our partnership - namely, that our abilities tended to be complementary,” wrote one of them. His partner “was better trained in circuit technology, and I was better trained and more experienced in manufacturing processes. This combination of abilities was particularly useful in designing and manufacturing electronic products.”
> 尽管一些最初的尝试颇有争议，但它们带来了收入并增强了这些人的自信。“它们还揭示了一些我们本未计划但对我们合作关系极为有益的东西——即我们的能力往往是互补的，”其中一人写道。他的搭档“在电路技术方面受过更好的训练，而我在制造工艺方面受过更好的训练且更有经验。这种能力的组合在设计和制造电子产品时尤其有用。”

As it occurred to them they might have a real business on their hands, they signed a partnership agreement. One of the men loaned the enterprise some money to buy components and tools. The other contributed tools. They decided the name of their company was too generic; they should name it after themselves. But given that they considered themselves equals, whose name should go first? They flipped a coin. When it landed, the name of the company became Hewlett-Packard.
> 当他们意识到自己可能拥有一个真正的生意时，便签署了合伙协议。其中一人借给企业一些钱用于购买零件和工具，另一人则出资提供工具。他们认为公司名称太普通；应该用他们的名字来命名。但既然他们自认平等，谁的名字应该排在前面？他们掷了一个硬币。当硬币落下时，公司名称便定为惠普（Hewlett-Packard）。

The coin flip between Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard is considered just an interesting anecdote among the larger legends of the company. The men made no big deal of it. Yet the simple method of decision making, reminiscent of playground customs, emerges surprisingly often in situations
> 比尔·惠利特（Bill Hewlett）和戴夫·帕卡德（Dave Packard）之间的抛硬币被视为公司众多传奇中的一个有趣轶事。两人并未大肆渲染此事。然而，这种类似于游乐场习俗的简单决策方法，在需要从伙伴中选择一人而又没有人愿意被看作排挤同伴的情形中，出人意料地常见。

In equitable partnerships, the coin toss often emerges at a crucial juncture. In 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright flipped a coin to decide who would get to fly their new airplane. Wilbur won, but he stalled and crashed. Three days later, his brother took the historic first flight. Like Hewlett and Packard, William Hanna and Joe Barbera flipped a coin to name their animation company. If heads, it would be Barbera and Hanna. If tails, it would be Hanna-Barbera. It was tails.
> 在平等的伙伴关系中，掷硬币常常在关键时刻出现。1903 年，奥维尔和威尔伯·莱特抛硬币决定谁先驾驶他们的新飞机。威尔伯赢了，但他失速并坠毁。三天后，他的弟弟完成了具有历史意义的首次飞行。就像惠普公司创始人休利特和帕卡德一样，威廉·汉纳和乔·巴伯拉也通过掷硬币来给他们的动画公司定名。正面的话就是“Barbera and Hanna”，反面就是“Hanna-Barbera”。结果是反面。

To keep things simple, one pair of Tacoma, Washington, real estate agents even wrote the coin flip into their legal papers. “I have a clause in my partnership agreement that should my partner and I ever disagree and feel so strongly that we cannot agree, then we have agreed to settle the issue by the toss of a coin,” said one of them. They have yet to invoke the rule, “although we joke about it sometimes.”
> 为简单起见，华盛顿州塔科马的一对房地产经纪人甚至把掷硬币写进了他们的法律文件。“我的合伙协议里有一条，如果我和我的合伙人之间产生分歧并且双方都觉得无法达成一致，那么我们同意通过掷硬币来解决问题，”其中一人说。他们尚未启用这条规则，“尽管我们有时会开玩笑提到它。”

On the surface, settling a dispute with a coin flip may seem inconsequential. But in psychological terms, invoking simple, indisputably fair rules is deeply symbolic of the fairness of an alliance.
> 表面上看，用掷硬币来解决争端似乎微不足道。但从心理学角度看，引用简单且无可争议的公平规则在象征联盟公平性方面意义重大。

In the early years of Hewlett-Packard, fairness was also created by the sheer volume of work to be done. There were too many products to be made and too few employees for anything other than both men working as hard as they could. “Basically, we divided it,” said Hewlett. “Packard had taken
> 在惠普的早年，公平感也来自于大量的工作要完成。需要做的产品太多，而员工太少，除了两个人都拼命工作外别无他法。“基本上，我们把工作分开了，”休利特说。“派卡德已经接受了

> 他在学校学过商业课程，而我没有。所以他更偏向商业方面，我更偏向工程方面，但我得说这样说太过简化。我们俩都有涉猎两方面。

The way they manufactured one of their earliest products, an audio oscillator, was quaint compared to the international corporation Hewlett-Packard would become. “We bought the cabinets but made the panels ourselves,” wrote Packard. “We sawed them out of aluminum and drilled the holes. Then we’d spray-paint them at home and use the kitchen oven to bake on the paint.” (Packard’s wife, Lucile, reportedly said food baked in the oven never tasted quite right after the appliance was co-opted for electronics production.) The panels were engraved at a friend’s facility. The dials were calibrated, and the calibration marks were engraved over pencil markings the two men made carefully on each instrument. “In the beginning, each of these oscillators was individually calibrated,” recalled Packard.
> 他们制造的最早期产品之一——音频振荡器——的方式，与后来成为的跨国公司惠普相比，显得颇为古朴。帕卡德写道：“我们买了机箱，但自己做面板。我们用锯把它们从铝板上锯下来并钻孔。然后我们在家里喷漆，用厨房烤箱把漆烤上去。”（据说帕卡德的妻子露西尔说，自从把烤箱挪去做电子产品后，烤出来的食物总觉得不太对味。）面板是在朋友的作坊里雕刻的。刻度盘经过校准，校准刻度是在两人小心地用铅笔在每台仪器上标记后再雕刻上去的。帕卡德回忆说：“一开始，每台这样的振荡器都是单独校准的。”

During World War II, Hewlett, already a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, was called back into active service. He was absent from the company for nearly five years. Packard decreased his own compensation to match that of Hewlett’s military pay. “I did not think it was fair for my salary to be higher than Bill’s army salary,” Packard concluded. Not only was it a substantial sacrifice, it was perfectly symbolic.

The fairness that Hewlett and Packard displayed toward each other was equally evident in their management practices, an approach that came to be known almost reverentially as “the HP Way.” When one of the employees fell ill with tuberculosis, the company helped pay for his care. Then the two founders arranged to offer catastrophic healthcare insurance for their employees, an unusual benefit at the time. While some other companies paid production bonuses to their engineers, Hewlett and Packard decided to pay them to all employees.
> 休利特和帕卡德在彼此之间表现出的公平在他们的管理实践中同样明显，这种做法几乎被尊为“惠普之道”。当一名员工患上肺结核时，公司帮助支付他的治疗费用。随后两位创始人安排为员工提供重大医疗保险保障，这在当时是一项不寻常的福利。虽然有些公司向工程师支付生产奖金，休利特和帕卡德决定向所有员工支付奖金。

As a matter of trust between the company and its employees, they instituted flexible work hours. “To my mind,” wrote Packard, “flextime is the essence of respect for and trust in people. It says that we both appreciate that our people have busy personal lives and that we trust them to devise, with their supervisor and work group, a schedule that is personally convenient yet fair to others.” They opened up bins that were previously locked as a precaution against theft. “Open bins and storerooms were a symbol of trust, a trust that is central to the way HP does business,” opined Packard.
> 作为公司与员工之间信任的一种体现，他们实行了弹性工作时间。“在我看来，”帕卡德写道，“弹性工作制是对人表示尊重和信任的核心。它表明我们既理解员工有繁忙的个人生活，又信任他们能与主管和工作小组一起制定既方便个人又对他人公平的时间安排。”他们打开了以前为防盗而上锁的储物箱。“打开的储物箱和库房是信任的象征，而信任是惠普经营方式的核心，”帕卡德认为。

Rather than lay off employees during difficult times, they reduced the hours and pay of employees across the board so all of them could keep their jobs until demand picked up again. The two founders lectured their managers in company memos and in person, saying that by asking people to work for them, they created a moral obligation to the employees. Packard and Hewlett bought recreational property in the company’s name and made it available for employees to
> 他们没有在困难时期裁员，而是普遍减少员工的工作时间和薪酬，以便所有人都能保住工作，直到需求回升。两位创始人在公司备忘录和面对面的讲话中训诫他们的经理们，指出既然雇用了这些人，他们就对员工负有道德义务。帕卡德和休利特以公司的名义购买了娱乐用地，并将其提供给员工

use for camping. As the business grew, they held company parties at which the founders served the food to ensure that they could greet everyone.
> 用于露营。随着业务的发展，他们举行公司聚会，创始人们亲自端上食物，以确保能与每个人打招呼。

“Over and over again, Hewlett and Packard faced business decisions that were, in the end, character choices,” wrote Michael S. Malone in his book about the partners. “Because they were men of character, Bill and Dave almost always made great business choices. It was their ultimate fallback position - ‘What is the right thing to do?’ - in the face of ambiguous data and conflicting pressures from investors, employees, and customers.”
> “在一次又一次的商业决策中，惠普公司（Hewlett and Packard）最终面对的，归根结底是性格的抉择，”迈克尔·S·马龙（Michael S. Malone）在关于这对合伙人的书中写道。“因为他们是有品格的人，比尔和戴夫几乎总是做出伟大的商业选择。在面对模糊的数据和来自投资者、员工及客户的冲突压力时，他们最终的退路就是‘什么是正确的事？’”

The HP Way is revered as being enlightened and ahead of its time. What is less appreciated is how this management philosophy was a natural extension of the partnership between Packard and Hewlett, a relationship that was, above all, fundamentally fair.

While people find fairness instinctive, they struggle to define it. Pressed for a definition, most people get no closer than U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart when challenged to define obscenity: “I know it when I see it.” The confusion stems from the fact that fairness is as much an emotional conclusion as a rational one. And there are different, opposing forms of fairness that apply, depending on the situation.
> 尽管人们觉得公平是一种直觉，但他们很难为其下定义。在被迫给出定义时，大多数人也不过像美国最高法院大法官波特·斯图尔特（Potter Stewart）在被要求定义猥亵时所说的那样：“当我看到它时，我就知道。”这种困惑源于公平既是情感上的结论也是理性的结论。并且，根据不同情境，会适用不同的、相互对立的公平形式。

The most basic form is equality, a 50-50 division of the work and the rewards. Such a perfect split rarely occurs

in practice. Any objective measurement of the work two people put into a project or the rewards they get from it would find at least a slight imbalance. Yet the symbolic value of an even division is often the assumed starting point and the ideal to which both partners aspire. It is the magnetic North Pole of most collaborations - intuitively appealing and difficult to argue, which is why it emerges in so many successful pairs. When Gallup asked people about the division of work and rewards in their best partnerships, nearly half said they and their collaborators evenly split both the work and the rewards.
> 实际上，对两个人在一个项目中投入的工作或从中获得的报酬进行任何客观衡量，都会发现至少有些微的不平衡。然而，均等分配的象征性价值常常被视为假定的起点和双方都追求的理想。它是大多数合作的磁北——直观上吸引人且难以反驳，这也是它在许多成功搭档中出现的原因。当盖洛普询问人们在他们最好的伙伴关系中工作和报酬的分配时，近一半的人表示他们和合作者在工作和报酬上都是均等分担。

A powerful partnership does not need to be equal to be fair. There are many times when one member of a dyad does more of the work, brings a rare talent, has far more experience, or otherwise “deserves” - the term is unavoidably subjective - a larger share of the reward. A child who is upset about getting less pay for household chores usually settles down when reminded that her sister did more of the work. Giving identical benefits to those whose workloads differ substantially is as unfair as giving vastly different rewards for the same work.
> 强有力的伙伴关系不需要平等才算公平。有许多情况下，二人小组中的一方承担了更多的工作、拥有稀有的天赋、具备远多于另一方的经验，或者以其他方式“应得”——这个词不可避免地带有主观性——更大份额的回报。因为做家务拿到较少报酬而不高兴的孩子，通常在被提醒她的妹妹做了更多工作后就会平静下来。对工作量差别很大的两个人给予相同的利益，和对做同样工作的人给予大相径庭的回报一样不公平。

In successful partnerships in which there is an uneven division of responsibilities, a corresponding division of rewards also occurs. You and your counterpart do not need to divide the work evenly, but you must make the rewards proportionate to the workload. Productive working relationships can be built on a 70-30 division of the work if there is a corresponding 70-30 division of the rewards. In the strongest relationships, there is even a certain degree
> 在那些责任分配不均但又成功的伙伴关系中，回报也会相应分配。你和你的搭档不必均分工作，但必须让回报与工作量成比例。如果回报按照 70-30 分配，基于 70-30 工作分配的高效合作关系是可以建立起来的。在最稳固的关系中，甚至存在一定程度的

of latitude or wiggle room. For example, some partners are happy doing 60 percent of the work and receiving just half the rewards.
> 回旋余地。例如，有些伙伴愿意做 60%的工作却只获得一半的回报。

There is a limit to this balance, according to Gallup’s research. If you are doing less than 20 percent of the work, you are the other person’s helper or assistant, not his partner. Of course, there are times in every collaboration when one of the pair is doing most or all of the work. Shifting the burden back and forth is common and productive, just as Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay took turns taking the lead up Everest. But all back and no forth will destroy the relationship.
> 根据盖洛普的研究，这种平衡是有界限的。如果你做的工作少于 20%，你就是对方的帮手或助理，而不是他的搭档。当然，在任何合作中都有这样的时刻：其中一方承担了大部分或全部工作。像埃德蒙·希拉里和丹增·诺尔盖在攀登珠穆朗玛峰时轮流领头一样，来回分担任务是常见且有成效的。但如果只有付出没有回报，关系就会破裂。

Alliances that leave one person shouldering too much of the load for too little of the reward fall into a zone almost exclusively populated by failed collaborations. “My least successful partnership was randomly established. We were to complete assessments for children in grades three and five that were aligned with the state-wide test,” said one teacher. “The partnership failed because the other person did not show up to discuss and plan for the project, nor did she complete her part of the assessments. I completed 80 percent of the work on my own and had to revise her portion significantly before going to press. The primary difference between this partnership and a successful one was her level of dedication. After my ‘partner’ in the endeavor failed to meet her end of the agreement, I lost all professional respect for her and could not trust that her work would represent the level of professionalism to which I am accustomed.”
> 那些让一个人承担过多工作却只获得很少回报的联盟，几乎都处于几乎完全由失败合作占据的领域。“我最不成功的合作是随意建立的。我们要为三年级和五年级的孩子完成与全州考试对齐的评估，”一位教师说。“这次合作失败是因为对方没有来讨论和规划该项目，也没有完成她负责的评估部分。我独自完成了 80%的工作，并在付印前不得不大幅修改她的部分。这个合作与成功合作的主要区别在于她的投入程度。在我在该事务中的‘合作者’未能履行她的责任后，我对她完全失去了职业上的尊重，也无法相信她的工作能达到我习以为常的专业水准。”

Creating an equitable collaboration is further complicated by the fact that we’re not very good at estimating our relative contributions to a shared project. You probably believe you’ve done a larger share of the work than you really have. Your partner probably suffers from the same egocentric bias.
> 创建公平的合作关系还因我们不善于准确估计自己对共同项目的相对贡献而变得更加复杂。你很可能认为自己做了比实际上更多的工作。你的合作者也很可能受到同样的自我中心偏差影响。

In 1979, two researchers from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, recruited 40 men from an introductory psychology class. The researchers told the men they were testing how well two people could brainstorm ideas to combat smoking. The men were asked to work together on defining the problem, generating ideas, discussing the alternatives, selecting a solution, and explaining their rationale. The subjects were told their work would be forwarded to the government’s Committee for the Prevention of Cigarette Smoking. Half were instructed to keep notes of their own contributions to the discussion. The other half kept notes of their partners’ ideas.
> 1979 年，加拿大安大略省滑铁卢大学的两位研究人员招募了 40 名入门心理学课程的男性学生。研究人员告诉这些男性，他们在测试两个人共同头脑风暴以对抗吸烟的效果。要求这些人一起定义问题、产生想法、讨论备选方案、选择解决方案并解释他们的理由。被试被告知他们的工作将转交给政府的“香烟吸食预防委员会”。其中一半人被指示记下自己对讨论的贡献，另一半则记下他们合作者的想法。

Two or three days later, each participant was brought back alone, asked to look over his notes, and then interviewed about “who tended to control the course and content of the discussion” in the first session. Regardless of whether participants made notes about themselves or the other students, they gave themselves the majority of the credit. The average test subject took 57 percent of the credit for generating ideas, 53 percent for evaluating those ideas, 57 percent for creating the final proposal, and 59 percent for the overall discussion.

To make your partnership fair, you will need to keep in mind that although you are aware of everything you do for the joint effort, much of what your partner does escapes your notice. If you are like most people, you also have an inflated opinion of the value of your contributions. Selfishness and the natural bias toward believing one has done more than a comrade creates a pothole in the road of many joint projects. “It is this proportionality - this fairness - that determines people’s satisfaction with their social and business interactions,” concluded one study. “But if people consistently overestimate their own contributions, they may feel they are doing more than their share - and that others are doing less than theirs.”
> 要使你的合作公平，你需要记住，尽管你清楚自己为共同努力所做的一切，但你往往注意不到合伙人所做的很多事情。如果你像大多数人一样，你也会高估自己贡献的价值。自私以及人们天生倾向于认为自己比同伴做得更多的偏见，为许多合作项目的道路造成了障碍。“正是这种比例关系——这种公平——决定了人们对其社交和商业互动的满意度，”一项研究总结道。“但如果人们持续高估自己的贡献，他们可能会感觉自己付出得比应有的多——而他人则付出得比他们应有的少。”

The Gallup partnership surveys found a similar pattern, but with a positive twist. In pairs that worked well, the average participant estimated that he did 54 percent of the work (meaning, of course, that he believed his counterpart did the remaining 46 percent). However, the average participant also believed he got 55 percent of the rewards. The two numbers are elegantly proportionate.

The average participant in a poor partnership, however, estimated she did 71 percent of the work and got only 41 percent of the rewards. There’s no telling whether those numbers are a true reflection of relative contribution and payoff. Those most likely to label a partnership as poor could, indeed, have gotten the raw end of the deal. It’s also likely that when a working relationship is bad, the natural egocentric bias is magnified. More than either statistic by itself, it is the perceived mismatch of work and rewards (71 > 41) that poisons the relationship.
> 然而，在一个糟糕的合作关系中，平均参与者估计自己做了 71%的工作，却只得到 41%的回报。无法确定这些数字是否真实反映了相对贡献和收益。那些最有可能将合作关系评为糟糕的人确实可能吃了亏。同样，当工作关系不佳时，自我中心的偏见往往被放大。比起单独的任一统计数据，正是这种工作与回报的感知不匹配（71 > 41）毒化了关系。

To be a great partner, you must continuously consider how much of the work your counterpart is shouldering and what she is getting for the effort. What rewards are most meaningful to her, and is she receiving them? Would you be willing to trade your work and rewards for hers? Are you truly working as equals? Addressing these issues requires candid conversations and a willingness, if needed, to take on more of the work for less of the rewards. Your collaborator needs to be similarly accommodating to you. Only when both partners are assured the other is more invested in the common mission than in a selfish pursuit do they, as the survey statement says, “not have to keep track of who does what and who gets credit for what.”
> 要成为一名出色的合作者，你必须不断考虑你的搭档承担了多少工作，以及她为这些付出得到了什么回报。哪些回报对她最有意义，她是否正在获得这些回报？你愿意用自己的工作和回报去换取她的工作和回报吗？你们是否真正作为平等者在工作？解决这些问题需要坦诚的对话，并在必要时愿意承担更多的工作而获得较少的回报。你的合作者也需要以同样的方式对你体谅。只有当双方都确信对方更为投入于共同的使命而非自私的追求时，正如调查声明所说，“就不必去计算谁做了什么、谁获得了什么功劳”。

Reaching this level is difficult even for society’s most highly educated members. Professors often squabble over who gets what.

"Alphabetic name ordering… which is the convention in the economics discipline and various other disciplines, is to the advantage of people whose last name initials are placed early in the alphabet,"states a paper with a title right out of Dr. Seuss: “The Benefits of Being Economics Professor A (and not Z).” “As it turns out,” the article continues, “Professor A, who has been a first author more often than Professor Z, will have published more articles and experienced a faster growth rate over the course of her career as a result of reputation and visibility. Moreover, authors know that name ordering matters and indeed take ordering seriously.”

Capuchin monkeys know how to solve this problem. In 2006, researchers paired up the primates and put them in a device that held two food cups, one for each monkey. The cups remained out of reach unless both exerted their strength to draw them within reach. The researchers put their subjects in a dilemma by sometimes loading one cup with an apple slice and one cup with the more desirable reward of a grape. Just like being the first-named author on an academic paper, only one of the collaborators could have the grape during a particular round.
> 卷尾猴知道如何解决这个问题。2006 年，研究人员把灵长类动物两两配对，放进一种装置里，装置有两个食物杯，每只猴子对应一个。除非两只猴子都用力把杯子拉到够得着的位置，否则杯子一直够不着。研究人员有时在一个杯子里放一片苹果，在另一个更受欢迎的杯子里放一颗葡萄，从而让被试陷入两难。就像在学术论文中被列为第一作者一样，在某一轮合作中只有一个伙伴能得到那颗葡萄。

But the capuchins could switch sides. And that’s just what the best partners did. The primatologists discovered that some of the teams - they labeled them “equitable pairs” - were better at taking turns being on the grape side of the mechanism, and by doing so, they were more

> 成功。另一些二人组，即“一方不公平的对”，其中一只猴子独占葡萄那一侧，当那只很少得到葡萄的猴子最终拒绝参与时，这些组合更容易失败。

The capuchins changed how well they worked together “contingent on the equity of their interactions with their partner,” wrote the scientists. “Dyads in which both individuals regularly alternated taking the higher value reward were more than twice as successful overall than lessequitable dyads.” Monkeys smart enough to alternate who got the grape cooperated to get themselves two to three times as much fruit.
> 卷尾冠猴在合作时会根据与伙伴互动的公平性来调整合作程度，科学家写道。“那些两只猴子交替轮流获取更高价值奖赏的二人组，其整体成功率比不那么公平的二人组高出两倍以上。”足够聪明以轮流谁吃葡萄的猴子，会合作从而让自己得到两到三倍的水果。

Such are the benefits of playing fair.

To teach police cadets how to search a dark building without getting shot, the Arizona Law Enforcement Academy puts people armed with paintball guns inside a building. They hide behind furniture or in closets, waiting for the trainees to flush them out. The instructors then send in pairs of recruits suited up in pads that protect them from direct hits.
> 为了教导警校学员怎样在不被射杀的情况下搜查黑暗建筑，亚利桑那执法学院让持有彩弹枪的人待在建筑物内。他们躲在家具后面或壁橱里，等待受训者将他们逼出来。然后教官派成对的新人穿上护垫进入，这些护垫能保护他们不被直接击中。

The goal is to find and disarm each suspect before he can “kill” or “wound” an officer. This doesn’t always work out as planned.
> 目标是在嫌疑人“杀死”或“打伤”一名警官之前找到并解除其武装。但事情并不总是按计划进行。

“During one of the drills, I was on one knee peeking into a dark room while my partner pointed a flashlight into the room from over my head,” one cadet reported on his blog. "He then pointed the light directly down on my head. He thought

he turned it off first. The suspect in the room immediately saw me and shot me in the hand. Even though we were in full pads, my fingers were unprotected. It is a painful place to get hit. I’m now sporting a colorful welt and blister on my index finger as a reminder of my partner’s great tactics."
> 他先把灯关了。房间里的嫌疑人立刻看到我并朝我的手开了一枪。尽管我们穿着全套护具，但我的手指没有保护。被打在那个地方很痛。我现在食指上有一道彩色的肿痕和水泡，时刻提醒着我搭档的‘高明战术’。”

Five months later, the same cadet, now a Phoenix police officer, stopped a car with an invalid license plate. Two men were inside the vehicle. “One of my squad mates saw me pull over the car and pulled in behind me to provide backup,” he wrote. “I approached the driver’s window and asked him for his license. He said he had no identification. The passenger was hiding one of his hands under his leg. I told him to let me see his hands. My backup officer walked up to the passenger side, and we both knew there was something wrong.”
> 五个月后，同一名学员，现为菲尼克斯警察，因车牌无效拦下一辆车。车内有两名男子。“我的一个小队队友看到我拦下那辆车，跟在我后面提供支援，”他写道。“我走到司机窗前让他出示驾照。他说他没有身份证。副驾驶把一只手藏在腿下。我让他把手拿出来给我看。我的支援警员走到副驾驶一侧，我们都知道有问题。”

The initial search turned up a gallon-sized freezer bag of marijuana in the back seat and a bag of cocaine in the passenger’s pocket. With both suspects in handcuffs, the officer returned to the car to search it further. “I walked back to the passenger side of the car and felt my heart start racing when I saw a 9 mm Ruger handgun sitting between the front seats partially under a piece of paper,” he wrote. “The hammer of the gun was cocked back, and it was loaded. It would have taken two seconds for the passenger to pick it up if he had wanted to.” A second loaded gun was hidden between the driver’s seat and the center console.
> 初次搜查在后座发现一个加仑装塑料冷冻袋的大麻，以及在乘客口袋里发现一包可卡因。将两名嫌疑人铐上后，警官回到车旁进一步搜查。“我走回车的副驾驶一侧，看到一把 9 毫米鲁格手枪放在前座之间、部分被一张纸覆盖时，感觉心跳开始加速，”他写道。“枪的枪机已上膛，且有子弹。如果乘客想拿，只需两秒钟。”第二把上了膛的枪藏在驾驶座与中控台之间。

“I had two guys committing serious felonies with loaded guns within reach,” wrote the rookie. “If my backup partner hadn’t arrived a few seconds after I did, I wonder if the

> 结果可能会有所不同。两个人对一个[警官]可能会促使他们冒险逃跑甚至开枪。

Every partner needs to be able to depend on his counterpart. Every partner takes a risk that the other person might fail, intentionally or innocently, leaving him with the light shining on him in the middle of a dark room. Every partner needs the dependable backup that is the difference between success and failure.
> 每个合伙人都需要能够依赖对方。每个合伙人都面临着对方可能会失败的风险，不论是故意还是无心，这种失败可能会将责任和关注的光芒全部照在他身上，置于黑暗中的房间中央。每个合伙人都需要可靠的后援，这种可靠性往往决定了成功与失败的差别。

This came through forcefully in Gallup’s analysis of people’s responses about their best and worst partnerships. Three statements about trust form the heart of the working relationship:
> 这一点在盖洛普对人们关于最佳与最差伙伴关系的回应分析中强烈显现。关于信任的三条陈述构成了合作关系的核心：

> 我们可以相互依靠，对方会履行他说或她说会做的事情。

> 的大脑会在对方采取合作行为之前就开始处理对方的合作意图。

Without trust, it’s better to work alone. Both people doubt whether the other will fulfill his end of the bargain. Both must verify the other’s actions. Both must make contingency plans in case their counterparts fail. The frustration and inefficiency of not being able to count on someone is more hassle than the burden of handling the full load alone. No trust, no partnership.
> 没有信任，还是单干为好。两个人都会怀疑对方是否会履行自己的承诺。双方都必须核实对方的行为。双方都必须制定应急计划，以防对方失责。无法依赖他人带来的挫败感和低效率，比起独自承担全部工作更令人头痛。没有信任，就没有伙伴关系。

You face a dilemma every time you interact with someone new. If he can be trusted, and if he learns to trust you, the two of you can be more successful working together than going it alone. But if one of you is not trustworthy, it’s better that you never even try to collaborate. This psychological fork in the road is one of the most important decisions a person makes. It’s one of the crucial reasons humans can distinguish so many faces and keep track of so many reputations. For our ancestors living under more dangerous conditions, making the wrong choice could be fatal. For us, success on a project, reputations, promotions, future opportunities, happiness, and careers all hang in the balance.
> 每次与新认识的人交往时，你都会面临一个两难抉择。如果他值得信赖，并且学会信任你，你们两人合作能够比各自为战更成功。但如果你们中有人不值得信任，那么最好根本不要尝试合作。这种心理上的分岔路是一个人所做出的最重要决定之一。这也是人类能辨认出如此多面孔并记住众多名声的关键原因之一。对生活在更危险环境中的祖先来说，做出错误选择可能致命。对我们而言，项目的成功、名誉、晋升、未来机会、幸福和职业生涯都岌岌可危。

Much of what we understand about trust is based on a simple experiment that has been replicated thousands of times, analyzed endlessly, made into a TV game show, and even factored into the United States’ military decisions during the Cold War.
> 我们对信任的许多理解都基于一个简单的实验，该实验已被重复进行数千次、反复分析、改编成电视游戏节目，甚至在冷战期间被纳入美国的军事决策之中。

Variations on this game have been played since the 1950s, when Princeton University mathematician Albert W. Tucker, looking for a way to illustrate a similar puzzle developed by two fellow researchers, created a story about two prisoners who were arrested together and interrogated separately by the police.

The American TV game show Friend or Foe? created a partner’s dilemma by squaring off two contestants whose trustworthiness determined how they would divide money they won together earlier in the show. Each had two buttons the other person could not see - one labeled “friend,” the other “foe.” If both players pushed “friend,” they split their winnings evenly. If both pressed “foe,” they both went home empty-handed. But if one pressed “friend” and one pressed “foe,” the defector got all the money, and his partner received nothing.
> 美国电视游戏节目《朋友还是敌人？》通过让两名参赛者对决制造出搭档困境，他们的可信度决定了如何分配早先在节目中共同赢得的钱。每人有两个按钮，对方看不到——一个标着“friend”（朋友），另一个标着“foe”（敌人）。如果两人都按“friend”，他们平分奖金。如果两人都按“foe”，两人都空手而归。但如果一人按“friend”而另一人按“foe”，背叛者将独吞全部奖金，而他的搭档则一无所获。

One episode brought back two contestants who were betrayed in earlier shows, but who had accumulated $7,500 working together. “Mike, playing the game with you has been fun, and I think you are a trustworthy person,” said fellow player Rob, putting his hand over his heart. “I’m giving you my word of honor that I will press 'friend.”’
> 一集中带回了两位在早期节目中被背叛的参赛者，但他们在合作中已经积累了 7500 美元。“迈克，和你一起玩很开心，我觉得你是个值得信赖的人，”同队的罗布把手放在胸前说。“我以我的荣誉向你保证我会按‘friend’。”

“Rob, we’ve both been here before, and it would be a shame to go away with nothing,” Mike reassured his counterpart.
> “罗布，我们都来过这里一次，如果两手空空离开那就太可惜了，”迈克向他的搭档保证。

They reached down and made their choices. Rob voted “friend.” Despite his reassurances, Mike chose “foe,” taking all the money for himself.
> 他们伸手做出了选择。罗布按了“friend”。尽管做了保证，迈克却选择了“foe”，把所有钱都揽为己有。

“I’m sorry,” he said as the show’s host berated him. “I couldn’t be sure. I couldn’t be sure.”
> “对不起，”当节目的主持人斥责他时他说。“我不敢确定。我不敢确定。”

“Things happen,” said a clearly angry Rob. “Maybe you’ll have a conscience sometime in the future… All the money in the world can’t buy you a clean conscience.”
> “事情会发生，”明显愤怒的罗布说。“也许将来你会有良心……天下的钱也买不来一颗干净的良心。”

Betrayal - often mutual betrayal - was quite common on Friend of Foe? “Thousands of dollars were left on the table,” wrote University of Chicago researcher John A. List. “In nearly 25 percent of the 117 games, both players chose not to cooperate, resulting in a net loss of nearly

Occasionally, however, mutual trust made both people richer. “I think we worked really well together.

It’s better for both of us to go home with half the money than one or the other to be broke.”

“Stacia, the other two teams voted ‘foe’ and walked away with nothing,” replied Jennifer. “Let’s go home feeling good about ourselves and with some money.”
> “斯塔西亚，另外两队投了‘敌人’，结果一无所获，”詹妮弗回答。“我们带着好心情和一些钱回家吧。”

In the early stages of a collaboration, both partners take a wait-and-see attitude, still in the clutches of the dilemma, not sure the other person is going to do his part. But if one cooperative move is matched by another, solid reputations form. The fear of being taken advantage of fades. Trust removes doubt. Trust eliminates the dilemma.

Cap completed without supply depots along the way. She was the first woman to ski solo and without depots to the South Pole. “I skied to the South Pole alone simply because I couldn’t find anyone to go with me,” wrote Arnesen. “The men who were planning trips did not want a woman on their teams; and the female sport skiers I talked to were not interested in the extended camping and harsh weather of an Antarctic trip.”
> 她完成了没有中途补给点的帽段（译注：cap 这里指行程或帽状顶点？原文为“Cap completed without supply depots along the way.”，若为专有或上下文不明确，保留原文）。她是第一位单独滑雪且不设补给点到达南极点的女性。“我独自滑雪到南极点，仅仅因为找不到愿意跟我一起去的人，”阿内森写道。“那些正在筹划行程的男性不想让女性加入他们的队伍；而我谈过的女性运动滑雪者对南极之旅所需的长期露营和恶劣天气也不感兴趣。”

In the fall of 1998, Arnesen boarded a plane to Minnesota so she and Bancroft could each determine whether the other would make a suitable counterpart on an arduous three-month journey largely beyond the reach of help from anyone else. “I hadn’t come with any expectations of what I thought she would be,” recalled the Norwegian. “I did have some idea of what I hoped she would not be: a publicity hound, or a chatter-box, or perhaps someone who was more in love with the idea of expeditions than the trips themselves. I had encountered all these types during my various searches for expedition partners over the years. Good expedition members are hard to find.”
> 1998 年秋天，阿内森登机飞往明尼苏达，和班克罗夫特见面，这样她们各自可以判断对方是否适合成为在几乎无法得到外界帮助的艰苦三个月旅程中的伙伴。“我来之前并没有对她会是什么样的人抱有任何期望，”这位挪威人回忆道。“不过我大致知道我希望她不要是什么样的人：不希望是个爱出风头的人，或者话匣子，或许也不想是那种更爱探险这个想法而非真正喜欢旅行本身的人。在多年来寻找探险伙伴的过程中，我遇到过所有这些类型。优秀的探险队员很难找。”

Some people with whom Arnesen traveled before “who seemed strong and resilient cracked from the pressure of harsh weather and isolation, leaving the remaining team members to wake them and dress them and strap their skis on for them every day,” wrote Arnesen.

success and failure. Assuming the woman standing in the baggage area of the Minneapolis airport with penguin stickers on her suitcase was Arnesen, Bancroft approached her. “I think I said something brilliant such as, ‘Uh, hello. Are you Liv?’ I was really thinking, ‘Can I trust you?’”
> 假设那位站在明尼阿波利斯机场行李区、行李箱上贴着企鹅贴纸的女人就是阿内森，班克罗夫特便走上前去。“我想我说了些什么很机智的话，比如，‘呃，你好。你是莉芙吗？’我当时真的在想，‘我能信任你吗？’”

The Norwegian also had doubts. “She looked skinny,” recalled Arnesen, “and I remember thinking, 'Is she strong enough for an expedition like this?”’ The visitor offered a handshake. “You must be Ann,” she said.
> 这位挪威人也有疑虑。“她看起来很瘦，”阿内森回忆道，“我记得当时在想，‘她够强壮适合这样的远征吗？’”那位来访者伸出手握手。“你一定是安，”她说。

Their concerns soon melted. The two former schoolteachers discovered they had a lot in common. Despite being raised an ocean apart, they had remarkably similar childhoods and dreams about the polar regions of the world, immersing themselves in books about explorers such as Roald Amundsen and Ernest Shackleton. “I just wanted to be there,” said Bancroft. “I wanted to be in those pictures, in those grubby clothes and with those dogs on the ice. I wanted all of that adventure.”
> 她们的顾虑很快消失了。两位前教师发现彼此有很多共同之处。尽管在大洋两岸长大，她们的童年和对极地的梦想惊人地相似，都沉迷于有关探险家如罗尔德·阿蒙森和欧内斯特·沙克尔顿的书籍。“我只想去那里，”班克罗夫特说。“我想出现在那些照片里，穿着脏兮兮的衣服，和那些狗一起站在冰上。我想要所有那些冒险。”

Arnesen’s doubts about Bancroft’s strength disappeared on a walk the next day when the Norwegian realized that, although small, the American was a powerful athlete. Her worries about Bancroft talking too much were also settled. As much as they enjoyed getting to know one another, “I noticed right away that we could also be comfortably silent,” said Arnesen.
> 第二天散步时，阿内森对班克罗夫特体力的怀疑就消失了，挪威人发现虽然她个子小，但却是个强壮的运动员。她对班克罗夫特话太多的担心也随之消解。尽管彼此相处愉快，“我立刻就注意到我们也能自在地沉默，”阿内森说。

“That was the moment I decided for certain to join the team,” said Arnesen. Later that week, she repeated to the larger team what she told her husband in a phone call on her first day in Minnesota: “I had found more than my next expedition; I had found my sostersjel, my sister soul.”

An expedition across Antarctica requires more of a partnership than does an alliance closer to civilization. Each woman had to rely on the other to pull a 250 -pound sled loaded with food, a stove, fuel, skis, tents, assorted gear, sails, first aid kits, communication equipment, and navigation tools. As part of their preparation, they used a pig’s foot to practice sewing up a deep laceration. “Stuff that’s no big deal here could be catastrophic in the wilderness,” said an emergency doctor who helped the two assemble their medical supplies. With little privacy and no one else around, every action had to be taken with consideration for how it would affect the other.
> 横贯南极的远征比靠近文明的联盟更需要伙伴关系。每个女人都必须依靠另一个人拉动一辆装有食物、炉具、燃料、滑雪板、帐篷、各种装备、帆、急救包、通讯设备和导航工具的 250 磅雪橇。作为准备的一部分，她们用猪蹄练习缝合深裂伤。“这里不是什么大事的东西在荒野中可能是灾难性的，”帮助两人准备医疗物资的一位急诊医生说。隐私很少、周围没有其他人，每一个行动都必须考虑到它将如何影响对方。

The trek lived up to its fearsome billing. The Antarctic broke sled poles, generated storms that made it impossible to see, battered their limbs, and sent them into bouts of depression when the weather halted their progress. Both women suffered frostbite and worried they might lose their fingers to the cold.
> 这次跋涉名副其实。南极折断了雪橇杖，刮起了能致盲的暴风，摧残他们的四肢，当天气阻止他们前进时，又使他们陷入抑郁。两位女性都冻伤了，担心会因严寒失去手指。

the journey. “The cooperation between us goes very well,” Arnesen wrote during the seventh week. Researchers who studied the partnership as it unfolded noted they had seen an expedition of two men under similar circumstances turn into traveling antagonism, the men motivated to continue by their hostility toward each other. But Arnesen and Bancroft were united by the educational goals of the mission and the hope it would provide a powerful example for schoolchildren.
> “我们之间的合作进展得很好，”阿内森在第七周写道。研究这一伙伴关系的学者在事后指出，他们曾见过类似情况下由两名男子组成的探险队演变成相互敌对的旅行，男人们被彼此的敌意驱使着继续前行。但阿内森和班克罗夫特因这次任务的教育目标以及希望为学童树立强有力榜样的愿望而团结一致。

The Antarctic unavoidably put a strain on the women’s working relationship. At one point during the trek, Bancroft pulled hard on the line to her sail just as a large gust of wind hit the fabric. The force yanked her arm outward, tearing a muscle in her right shoulder. “The pain in the front of my right shoulder was excruciating and felt as if someone had jabbed a hot poker into my body,” she recalled.
> 南极洲不可避免地给两位女性的工作关系带来了压力。在探险途中的一次，班克罗夫特在拉帆索时猛用力，恰逢一阵大风吹在帆布上。强大的冲力将她的手臂向外拽动，撕裂了右肩的一块肌肉。“我右肩前侧的疼痛剧烈得令人难以忍受，就像有人用烫红的铁棍戳进我的身体一样，”她回忆道。

“I knew Ann was badly hurt,” wrote Arnesen. “I didn’t see her fall, but her body language was unmistakable. She was in desperate pain.” The Norwegian wondered if her partner was refusing to acknowledge the severity of her injury. Over the next two days, the pair made good progress, sailing and skiing more than 66 miles, but Bancroft’s injury forced them to stop roughly every half hour. Unbeknownst to Arnesen, the American was struggling with feelings of guilt about letting down her counterpart.
> “我知道安受了重伤，”阿尔内森写道。“我没看到她摔倒，但她的肢体语言明显表明了这一点。她痛得很绝望。”这位挪威人怀疑她的搭档是否在拒绝承认伤势的严重性。在接下来的两天里，两人取得了不错的进展，滑行和航行共超过 66 英里，但班克罗夫特的伤势迫使她们大约每半小时就要停下来休息一次。阿尔内森并不知道，美国人正在为辜负她的同伴而挣扎着内疚。

“Though I knew I had to talk to her about her injury, I wasn’t sure how,” recalled Arnesen. “So my way of showing her that I knew she was hurt was to offer help.” During one of their breaks, Arnesen brought Bancroft something

“Listen!” Bancroft exploded, “I’m not one of the helpless tourists on your trips to Svalbard! I’m perfectly capable of managing on my own!” Angry and hurt, Arnesen set down the thermos she brought her teammate and walked back to her own sled, trying to keep her temper in check.
> “听着！”班克罗夫特爆发道，“我又不是你那些去斯瓦尔巴德旅游时无助的游客！我完全能自己应付！”阿讷森又气又伤地把给队友带来的保温瓶放下，走回自己的雪橇，努力控制住脾气。

“Ann, I know you are capable, and I didn’t mean to imply that you weren’t,” Arnesen said after the pain in Bancroft’s arm forced them to stop for the day. “I’m just trying to be helpful because I know you are hurting.” Bancroft apologized for her outburst, explaining that she felt patronized. They joked and laughed, cracking the winddried skin on their faces.
> “安，我知道你能行，我并不想暗示你不行，”在班克罗夫特手臂的疼痛迫使他们当日停下时，阿讷森说道。“我只是想帮忙，因为我知道你在受苦。”班克罗夫特为她的突然发作道了歉，说明她感到被居高临下对待。她们开玩笑、大笑，笑得脸上风干的皮肤都裂开了。

“I think we misunderstood each other sometimes so thoroughly that we were almost on two different expeditions,” wrote Arnesen.
> “我想我们有时互相误解得那么彻底，几乎像是进行了两次不同的远征，”阿讷森写道。

During their three months on the ice, the women agonized over the lack of wind they needed to cover the distance before the Antarctic summer ended. They fretted over gear that broke and the unforgiving terrain. Yet each was concerned about not letting down her partner. In circumstances that would put any relationship to one of its most severe tests, the women stuck together. Although “we each had our ways of getting on the other one’s nerves,” they trusted each other and proved themselves trustworthy.
> 在冰面上度过的三个月里，这些女性为缺乏足以让她们在南极夏季结束前穿越所需的风而痛苦不已。她们为损坏的装备和无情的地形而忧心忡忡。然而，每个人都担心辜负自己的搭档。在这种会把任何关系置于极端考验的情况下，这些女性团结在一起。虽然“我们每个人都有让对方恼火的方式”，但她们彼此信任，并证明了自己值得信赖。

While the partnership was strong, the wind was not. Arnesen and Bancroft did not cross all of Antarctica, but they did cover the entire land mass beneath the ice more than 1,700 miles in 94 days - in temperatures that ranged from 14 to -31 degrees Fahrenheit. Their intense disappointment was tempered by the fact that an estimated 3 million children on five continents followed their progress and cheered them on.
> 尽管搭档关系稳固，风却不如人意。阿内森和班克罗夫特并没有横穿整个南极洲，但她们确实覆盖了冰层下整个陆地——在 94 天里行进了超过 1700 英里——气温在华氏 14 度到零下 31 度之间波动。她们的巨大失望被这样一个事实所缓和：据估计，来自五大洲的约 300 万名儿童关注着她们的进展并为她们加油。

After making the difficult decision to stop, the adventurers agreed to be patched in by telephone to a group of third-, fourth- and fifth-graders in Faribault, Minnesota. Already at their low point, the women were concerned they would be talking with a group of disappointed kids. Instead, the students talked about how the expedition had enlivened their studies. They took turns asking questions. They sang a song they wrote for the women.
> 在做出停止的艰难决定后，探险者们同意通过电话与明尼苏达州法里博的一群三、四、五年级学生连线。正处于低谷的她们担心会面对一群失望的孩子。相反，学生们谈起了这次探险如何让他们的学习变得更有活力。他们轮流提问。他们唱了一首为这些女性写的歌。

Then a boy named Logan came to the phone and, putting aside the index card on which he had written a question, said, “I just wanted to tell you that both of you have been real role models to me. Sometimes I have a hard time with school, and I just used to feel like there were things I could never do. And now that you guys have done this, I see that I can do anything I put my mind to. You changed my life.”
> 然后一个名叫洛根的男孩接过电话，放下写着问题的索引卡，说道：“我只是想告诉你们，你们俩对我真的是榜样。有时候我在学校很吃力，我过去总觉得有些事情我永远做不到。现在你们做到了这件事，我看到了只要下定决心就能做到任何事。你们改变了我的人生。”

Before leaving the ice, Bancroft and Arnesen got the chance to visit Shackleton’s hut at Cape Royds. “It was like coming full circle,” wrote Bancroft. “We had a chance to walk into the very pictures we had pored over as girls dreaming of Antarctica.”
> 在离开冰地之前，班克罗夫特和阿内森有机会参观了罗伊兹角的沙克尔顿小屋。“那感觉像是一个圆满的结局，”班克罗夫特写道，“我们有机会走进那些我们小时候梦想着南极时反复端详的画面里。”

More than 350 years ago, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes concluded that the incentives to be selfish when dealing with someone else are too strong to be resisted. He would have told you to put nothing in the envelope because the other person was almost certainly going to do the same.
> 350 多年前，哲学家托马斯·霍布斯得出结论：在与他人交往时，利己的诱因强大到难以抗拒。他会告诉你别往信封里放任何东西，因为对方几乎肯定也会这样做。

The incentives in life naturally pull people toward “war of every man against every man,” he wrote. As each person pursues his or her selfish interests, human existence is doomed to be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”
> 他写道，生活中的种种诱因自然而然地把人们拉向“人人相争的战争”。随着每个人追求自身的自利利益，人类的存在注定是“孤独的、贫困的、肮脏的、野蛮的且短暂的”。

Nobel Prize winner John Nash, portrayed in the movie A Beautiful Mind, looked for the patterns of behavior into which games of trust would settle if each player did what was best for himself. The “Nash Equilibrium,” as it’s called, of the envelope experiment is for both people to withhold their money every time.
> 诺贝尔奖得主约翰·纳什，在电影《美丽心灵》中被描绘，研究了如果每个参与者都只做对自己最有利的事，信任博弈会落入何种行为模式。所谓“纳什均衡”在信封实验中就是两人每次都把钱留下不交。

John von Neumann, one of the pioneers of this type of strategic thinking, even recommended the United States launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union before the Soviets struck first. Agreeing with von Neumann, his contemporary Bertrand Russell argued a first strike

For many decades, educated theorists dismissed people who are trusting as just too stupid to really understand the game. “Evidently,” concluded one book on the subject, “the run-of-the-mill players are not strategically sophisticated enough to have figured out that strategy DD [mutual defection] is the only rationally defensible strategy.”
> 数十年来，受过教育的理论家们将信任他人的人视为愚蠢，认为他们不可能真正理解博弈。“显然，”一本关于此主题的书得出结论，“普通玩家的战略洞察力还不足以弄清楚策略 DD（相互背叛）是唯一能在理性上自我辩护的策略。”

And, of course, every experienced collaborator has several stories of serious breaches, when trust was repaid with treachery, when perhaps Hobbes and Nash and von Neumann were right. At one retail firm, the highly effective partnership between two regional vice presidents, one responsible for the west half of the United States and the other responsible for the east, ended when one of them resigned and joined a competitor. “I invested a lot in him, and this is how he repays me?” said the one left behind. “To hell with him.”
> 当然，每位有经验的合作者都有几段关于严重背信的故事：当信任被背叛回报时，或许霍布斯、纳什和冯·诺依曼说得对。在一家零售公司，负责美国西半区和负责东半区的两位区域副总裁之间极为有效的合作关系在其中一人辞职并加入竞争对手后终结了。“我在他身上投入了很多，他竟然这样回报我？”留下来的那位这样说道。“管他去死吧。”

In the midst of this cynicism, political scientist and professor Robert Axelrod organized a curious competition. In 1979, Axelrod decided to use computers to seek the best strategy for when to extend and when to withhold one’s trust. He invited experts to submit programs that were, in essence, a set of rules stating when a player would cooperate and when it would defect in a series of interactions similar to the envelope experiment.
> 在这种愤世嫉俗之中，政治学家、教授罗伯特·阿克塞尔罗德组织了一场奇特的竞赛。1979 年，阿克塞尔罗德决定利用计算机来寻找在何时应当伸出信任、何时应当拒绝信任的最佳策略。他邀请专家提交程序，这些程序本质上是一套规则，说明在一系列类似于信封实验的互动中，玩家何时会合作、何时会背叛。

Fourteen people agreed to participate in the tournament. They came from the disciplines of psychology, economics,
> 十四个人同意参加这次比赛。他们来自心理学、经济学等学科，

political science, mathematics, and sociology. “Most of the entrants were recruited from those who had published articles on game theory in general or the prisoner’s dilemma in particular,” wrote the professor. No one could claim they were “not strategically sophisticated enough” to understand the power of being distrustful. They submitted a diverse group of strategies. Just like the variety of potential partners you encounter in any setting, the programs included jerks, saints, and many permutations in between.
> 政治学、数学和社会学。“大多数参赛者都是从那些曾经发表过博弈论相关文章或特别是囚徒困境研究的人中招募的，”这位教授写道。没有人能声称他们“在战略上不够成熟”，无法理解不信任的力量。他们提交了多样化的一组策略。就像你在任何环境中遇到的潜在合作伙伴的多样性一样，这些程序包括混蛋、圣人以及介于两者之间的各种变体。

The winner of the tournament turned out to be the simplest of all the programs. It was submitted by Russianborn psychologist Anatol Rapoport. Called “Tit for Tat,” it began by cooperating on the first move, and then it just mimicked what its counterpart did on the previous move. In its simplicity, Tit for Tat was an elegant solution to the trust problem. It had several features of a good human partner that made it most successful in the tournament.
> 锦标赛的赢家证明是所有程序中最简单的一个。它由出生于俄罗斯的心理学家阿纳托尔·拉波波特提交。被称为“以牙还牙”的程序在第一步开始时选择合作，然后只是模仿对方在上一步所做的动作。正因为它的简单，以牙还牙成为解决信任问题的优雅方案。它具有几项优秀人类伙伴的特征，这些特征使其在锦标赛中最为成功。

It got things off on the right foot by displaying trust on the beginning move, and unless it was betrayed, it never proved untrustworthy. In these ways, Tit for Tat and the others that performed best in the contest were not what Hobbes or Nash or von Neumann would have predicted. “Surprisingly, there is a single property which distinguishes the relatively high-scoring entries from the relatively lowscoring entries. This is the property of being nice, which is to say never being the first to defect,” wrote Axelrod. When two trusting strategies met each other, they formed an elementary partnership, cooperating through almost the entire game, raising each other’s scores along the way.
> 它通过在一开始就表现出信任把事情做好开端，除非这种信任被背叛，否则它从未被证明是不可信的。就这些方面而言，“以牙还牙”和在比赛中表现最好的其他策略，并不是霍布斯、纳什或冯·诺依曼所会预测的那样。“令人惊讶的是，有一个单一特性将相对高分的条目与相对低分的条目区分开来。这个特性就是‘仁慈’——也就是说从不第一个背弃，”阿克塞尔罗德写道。当两个信任性的策略相遇时，它们形成了一种最基本的伙伴关系，几乎在整场博弈中都在合作，并在此过程中互相提高分数。

While it was friendly, Tit for Tat was no fool. As soon as it was betrayed, it retaliated on the next move and would continue refusing to cooperate until the other player ceased the hostilities. Because of this reflex, the strategy was “not very exploitable,” wrote Axelrod. Such a fallback is crucial to the survival of otherwise obliging individuals. Without retaliation to keep them in check, just a few egotists or attackers can quickly overrun a benevolent population. Appealing to a sense of fair play works with most people, but a pernicious minority will exploit their colleagues’ trust if nothing stands in their way.
> 虽然它很友好，但以牙还牙并不愚蠢。一旦遭到背叛，它会在下一步进行报复，并会持续拒绝合作，直到对方停止敌对行为。艾克塞尔罗德写道，正因为这种本能反应，这一策略“并不容易被利用”。这种后盾对本来乐于助人的个体的生存至关重要。如果没有报复来约束他们，少数自私者或攻击者就能迅速压倒善良的群体。诉诸公平感对大多数人有效，但如果没有任何阻碍，一个恶意的少数会利用同伴的信任。

Another winning feature of Tit for Tat was that as fast as it went to battle stations, it just as quickly returned to trusting when its counterpart did so. It was forgiving. “Of all the nice rules, the one that scored lowest was also the one that was least forgiving,” Axelrod found.
> 以牙还牙的另一个获胜特征是，它在进入战备状态的同时，一旦对方回归信任也会同样迅速地回到信任状态。它是有宽恕性的。艾克塞尔罗德发现：“在所有友好的规则中，得分最低的也是最不宽容的那一种。”

The professor decided to try the experiment again, distributing the results of the first tournament to drum up additional interest. He wanted to know if more players and a wider variety of strategies could improve the results. Axelrod invited the initial set of players to try again. He also took out ads in computer journals. The response was more than he anticipated. Sixty-two entries came in from the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Norway, Switzerland, and New Zealand. They came from professors of computer science, physics, economics, psychology, mathematics, sociology, political science, and evolutionary biology. One came from a 10-year-old kid.
> 教授决定再次尝试该实验，并公布第一次锦标赛的结果以吸引更多关注。他想知道是否更多的参与者和更丰富的策略会带来更好的结果。Axelrod 邀请了最初的参赛者再次参与，并在计算机期刊上登了广告。回应超出了他的预期。共有 62 份参赛作品来自美国、加拿大、英国、挪威、瑞士和新西兰。作者包括计算机科学、物理学、经济学、心理学、数学、社会学、政治学和进化生物学的教授。其中一份来自一个 10 岁的孩子。

There were more than a million moves in the second tournament. All those who entered a strategy knew Tit for Tat won the first tournament, and why. Yet when all the strategies had a chance to interact with each other, the winner was once again Rapoport’s simple rule, which he resubmitted unaltered from the first tournament. “So Tit for Tat, which got along with almost everyone, won the second round of the tournament just as it had won the first round,” wrote Axelrod. It is “clearly a very successful strategy,” he concluded.
> 在第二次锦标赛中进行的对局超过一百万局。所有参赛的策略都知道“以牙还牙”赢得了第一次锦标赛，并且知道其原因。然而，当所有策略彼此交互时，赢者再次是拉波波特的简单规则，他从第一次锦标赛原封不动地重新提交了该规则。“因此，几乎与所有人都能相处的以牙还牙，就像在第一轮获胜那样，赢得了第二轮的锦标赛，”阿克塞尔罗德写道。他总结说，这“显然是一个非常成功的策略”。

The lesson in Axelrod’s tournament lies in how forcefully it contradicts the supposedly savvy strategy of being selfish. Hobbes was wrong. Nash was wrong. Von Neumann, thankfully, was wrong. People are not purely selfish and calculating; they are reciprocating, both positively and negatively. They reflect what they receive. Reciprocity is one of the most powerful forces in human nature. In many ways, Axelrod’s tournament confirmed the wisdom of a passage in the Edda, a

> 阿克塞尔罗德锦标赛的教训在于它有力地反驳了所谓精明的自私策略。霍布斯错了。纳什错了。冯·诺依曼，幸好，也错了。人们并非纯粹自私和精于算计；他们会以正面或负面的方式进行互惠。他们会反映出所收到的对待。互惠是人性中最强大的力量之一。在许多方面，阿克塞尔罗德的锦标赛证实了《埃达》一段话的智慧，埃达是一本公元

the trust they place in you. If you’re not careful, you could be so “strategically sophisticated” that no one wants to work with you or that you fail to recognize or reciprocate collaborative overtures from people all around you. Just like Tit for Tat, you need to be eager to cooperate; to make early, friendly overtures to your partner; to stubbornly refuse to make the first hostile or neglectful move; and to be quite willing to forgive.
> 他们对你的信任。如果你不小心，自己可能会变得“策略上老练”到令人望而却步的地步，导致没人愿意和你共事，或者你无法识别或回应周围人的合作示好。就像以牙还牙策略（Tit for Tat）一样，你需要渴望合作；要主动对你的伙伴表示友好；坚决不先采取敌对或忽视的行动；并且要很愿意宽恕他人。

The ultimate twist to the research on trust is what it reveals about your collaborative environment. If you are like most people, you assume you are simply making reasonable reactions to the people with whom you interact. You believe you are working with the hand you were dealt. To the degree you compete, you probably feel as though you are just reacting to the competition around you. You probably attribute your lack of partnerships to a lack of good partners. But in a Tit for Tat world, where most people return good for good and bad for bad, the world you inhabit is the world you make.
> 关于信任研究的最终转折在于它揭示了你的合作环境。如果你像大多数人一样，你会认为自己只是对与之交往的人作出合理反应。你相信自己是在与手中所持的牌打交道。在你竞争的程度上，你可能觉得自己只是对周围的竞争做出反应。你可能会把缺乏伙伴关系归咎于缺乏好伙伴。但在一个以牙还牙的世界里，大多数人以善报善、以恶报恶，你所处的世界正是你所创造的世界。

Your reputation precedes you, biasing the way new colleagues deal with you. Your first moves, friendly or hostile, tip the balance for future interactions. When you exhibit trust, you will most often find trustworthiness. When you are selfish, you will most often find selfishness. When you compete, others must resort to competition. If you choose to play the game strictly for your own advantage, your attempts at collaboration will indeed be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”
> 你的名声先行，会影响新同事与你相处的方式。你最初的举动，无论友好还是敌对，都会决定未来互动的天平。当你表现出信任时，你通常会发现对方也值得信任。当你自私时，你通常会遇到自私的人。当你竞争时，别人也不得不以竞争应对。如果你选择只为自身利益而玩这场游戏，你的合作尝试确实会是“孤独、可怜、卑劣、残酷且短暂的”。

In the end, the degree to which you succeed in forming trusting partnerships is less a reflection of how much people trust you than how much you trust them - less a reflection of their trustworthiness than of your own.

One fact about partnerships is so uncomfortable that your first reaction probably is to deny it: You form partnerships fastest and easiest with people most like yourself. Deep-seated biases make you more trusting of those who look most like you, who think like you, or with whom you have the most in common, whether you’re from the same town, attended the same school, are fans of the same team, or mirror each other on more controversial factors such as race, age, religion, or sex.

As much as people like to think of themselves as equal-opportunity collaborators, the research demonstrates they are not, at least at first.

When nearly 100 pairs of twins were put in the same kind of partner’s dilemma as used in Robert Axelrod’s computer tournament, identical twins, genetic copies of each other, collaborated much better than fraternal twins, who are no more genetically alike than any other pair of brothers or sisters. One Canadian researcher tricked her subjects by digitally morphing their own photos with those of strangers and presenting the results as the faces of people with whom the volunteer was playing a game of trust. People trusted the “self-morphs” more than photos created from the images of two strangers. (Another study even found that when people adopt a purebred puppy, they tend to choose dogs that look like themselves.)
> 当近 100 对双胞胎被置于与 Robert Axelrod 在计算机竞赛中使用的同类合作困境时，同卵双胞胎——彼此的基因复制体——的合作要比异卵双胞胎好得多，后者在基因上与任何其他一对兄弟姐妹并无更多相似。一位加拿大研究者通过数字手段将受试者自己的照片与陌生人的照片融合，并把结果呈现为志愿者在信任游戏中对手的面孔来欺骗受试者。人们比起由两名陌生人图像合成的照片，更信任那些“自我融相”照片。（另一项研究甚至发现，当人们领养纯种小狗时，往往会选择长得像他们自己的狗。）

Sociologists call the degree of similarity between people “social distance.” Its consequences for collaboration are often more important than the physical distance separating two counterparts. Humans are tribal creatures, constantly drawing boundaries - sometimes prejudicial boundaries between friends and foes.

Eighty-three percent of those in a good partnership agree with the second statement, but only 16 percent in poor working relationships do so. The most effective pairs are also far more likely to agree with the other two statements. As with the other elements of collaboration, only those who strongly agree to all three statements can be said to have an excellent partnership.

teamed up to prepare the music for a Sunday morning worship service. “Practice was a nightmare,” he said. “I think we both felt the other was attacking when pointing out something that needed to be changed. There was also a generation gap. I was ‘old and outdated’ in his eyes, and I struggled with some of the off-the-wall ideas he had. We ended up fighting over whether or not to play a certain chord somewhere and what order to play the songs in. Everything said was met with defensiveness and said with a semi-joking, passive-aggressive attitude. I haven’t worked with this person since, and I would avoid doing so in the future.”
> 他们一起为周日上午的礼拜准备音乐。“排练简直是噩梦，”他说。“我想我们俩在指出需要改变的地方时都觉得对方在攻击自己。还有代沟问题。在他眼里我‘老而过时’，而他的一些异想天开的主意让我很难接受。我们最终为是否在某处弹某个和弦、以及歌曲的顺序吵了起来。说的每句话都会引来防备，而且带着半开玩笑的被动攻击的态度。我从那以后就没再和这个人合作过，今后也会尽量避免。”

Even if the social distance between you and your partner is small, incorporating his or her personality into your preferred way of working can be difficult. Mutual irritation is common in partnerships, particularly in the early stages. There is a natural propensity to believe you are normal and that the other person, to the degree she differs from you, is a bit off.
> 即便你和合伙人的社交距离很小，将他或她的个性融入你偏好的工作方式也可能很困难。相互恼怒在合伙关系中很常见，尤其在初期。人们很自然地倾向于认为自己是正常的，而另一方在与你不同的程度上有点不对劲。

Psychologists call it egocentrism. We tend to forget or disregard information that disagrees with us, but we remember what reinforces our own views. We are inclined to believe positive news about those we like and negative information about those we don’t. We suffer the hubris of “egocentric infallibility,” thinking what we believe must be true because we would not believe something unless it were true. And we are hypocrites, believing or professing one thing and doing another, sometimes not even noticing the
> 心理学家称之为自我中心主义。我们倾向于忘记或忽视那些与我们意见不合的信息，而会记住强化自己观点的内容。我们更容易相信有关我们喜欢之人的正面消息，以及有关我们不喜欢之人的负面信息。我们患有“自我中心的不犯错错觉”的狂妄，认为自己所信必为真，因为我们不会相信不真实之事。我们也是伪君子，说一套做一套，有时甚至不会注意到自身的矛盾

contradiction in ourselves while having a finely honed sense for spotting it in others.
> 而对他人的矛盾却有敏锐的嗅觉。

“Egocentric thinking emerges from our innate human tendency to see the world from a narrow, self-serving perspective,” wrote one pair of experts on human thinking. “We naturally think of the world in terms of how it can serve us. Our instinct is to continually operate within the world, to manipulate situations and people, in accordance with our selfish interests.”
> “自我中心的思维源于我们天生将世界视为狭隘、自利视角的倾向，”一对研究人类思维的专家写道。“我们天性以世界如何为我们服务来思考。我们的本能是不断在世界中行事，操纵情境和他人，以符合我们自私的利益。”

Egocentrism kills partnerships. It’s impossible to work effectively with someone if you, blind to your own failings, spend too much energy finding fault with your comrade. Partnerships require both people to accommodate each other’s foibles. “The cockpit can be a small place, especially when laboring with someone who has a different philosophical bent or focus on details,” said one captain for a major American airline. “As we sometimes say to friends when flying with those free spirits, 'We are on Day 12 of a five-day trip.”
> 以自我为中心会毁掉合作关系。如果你对自己的缺点视而不见，却花太多精力去挑剔搭档，就不可能与他有效合作。合作需要双方包容对方的怪癖。“驾驶舱可能很小，尤其是和那些在哲学倾向或细节关注上与自己不同的人一起工作时，”一位美国大航空公司的机长说。“正如我们有时与那些随性的人同机时对朋友说的，‘我们这次五日行程已经进行到第十二天了。’”

time you waste trying not to hurt your partner’s feelings, and in the end, it won’t do you a bit of good because your partner knows you are a crass, unfeeling egomaniac interested only in yourself. And wait until you are forced to spend time with someone who hates you because, walking into a room together, six people know your name and only five in the room know your partner’s. Clearly you have been up to something criminous at his expense."
> 你浪费时间去尽量不伤害你合伙人的感情，结果毫无意义，因为你的合伙人知道你是一个粗鲁、无情、自我中心的自恋狂，只关心自己。等到你被迫和一个痛恨你的人一起待着的时候就知道了：一起走进一个房间，六个人知道你的名字，只有五个人认识你的合伙人。显然你是在以他的名义干了些什么见不得人的事。”

“And the writing itself,” he continues. “Two months into the partnership and you will wonder how you ever managed to get yourself saddled with a logically challenged half-wit who is functionally illiterate to boot. Your partner, meanwhile, thinks exactly the same thing but blames it on your Alzheimer’s and sends you a box of Depends on your birthday . . . just in case.”
> “还有写作本身，”他继续说。“合伙两个月后，你会想不通自己当初怎么会把一个逻辑薄弱、半个笨蛋还几乎不识字的人扯进来当合伙人。与此同时，你的合伙人也在想同样的事，只不过他把原因归咎于你的老年痴呆症，并在你生日那天寄来一箱成人纸尿裤……以防万一。”

If you can’t find a way to accept your counterpart’s personality, the parishioner, the pilot, and Murphy are right. The Christmas program will be torture, the flights too long, and coauthoring the book a huge chore. You can easily justify finding fault with your counterpart because every one of his or her strengths can be upended and seen as a weakness. A colleague who excels in generating ideas will of course be less practical, because thinking outside the box starts with ignoring the box. Someone who takes command can be viewed as bossy. A partner who carefully assesses the risks can be tagged as “chicken.”
> 如果你找不到办法接纳对方的性格，那位教区教徒、那位飞行员和墨菲都是对的。圣诞节目会变成折磨，飞行会太漫长，与人合著书籍会变成一项沉重的差事。你很容易找到对方的不是，因为他或她的每一项优点都可以被颠倒过来而被看作缺点。一个擅长提出创意的同事当然会被认为不够务实，因为跳出思维定势的起点就是忽略既有框架。那个喜欢掌控局面的人会被视为爱发号施令。一个仔细评估风险的合作者会被贴上“胆小”的标签。

All his life, Vivien Thomas wanted to be a doctor. But in 1930, the aspiring black 19-year-old saw his savings from seven years of carpentry work, his hopes of attending college, and his “trust in everything and everybody” evaporate when the bank where he kept those savings folded.
> 维维恩·托马斯一生都想成为一名医生。但在 1930 年，这位有抱负的 19 岁黑人看到他七年木工工作积蓄、上大学的希望以及他“对一切和所有人”的信任在银行倒闭时化为乌有。

At the time, he had been working only a few months for Alfred Blalock, a white 31-year-old Vanderbilt University Hospital physician trying to come back from his own setback of not having received a surgical residency at Johns Hopkins, where he attended medical school. Blalock was in charge of the research lab at Vanderbilt, and he hired Thomas to assist him in conducting experiments.
> 当时，他只为阿尔弗雷德·布拉洛克工作了几个月。布拉洛克是一位 31 岁的白人，任职于范德堡大学医院，他正试图从未能在约翰斯·霍普金斯获得外科住院医师资格这一挫折中恢复过来，布拉洛克负责范德堡的研究实验室，他雇佣托马斯协助他进行实验。

Blalock was highly driven, inclined to take on as much as possible. Even as a boy, he was unwilling to go to bed until his homework was done to his satisfaction. He would cry if he was forced to go to bed before he memorized all his spelling words. A friend warned Thomas about Blalock; he “understood the guy was ‘hell’ to get along with and didn’t think I’d be able to work with him.” Needing the job, Thomas applied anyway. He found Blalock, at their first meeting, to be easygoing, quiet, and serious. "I want someone in the laboratory whom I can teach to do anything
> 布莱洛克有强烈的进取心，倾向于承担尽可能多的事情。甚至在他还是一个男孩的时候，他也不愿意在作业做得令自己满意之前就上床睡觉。如果在把所有拼写单词都记住之前被迫上床睡觉，他会哭泣。一个朋友曾警告托马斯关于布莱洛克；他“觉得这家伙‘难相处’，不认为我能和他共事。”但因需要这份工作，托马斯还是去应聘了。他在第一次见面时，觉得布莱洛克随和、沉默且认真的人。“我想要实验室里有人，我可以教他做任何我能做的事，也许还能做出我做不到的事，”医生告诉他的新雇员。

POWER OF 2

> 力量的二重奏

I can do and maybe do things I can’t do," the doctor told his new hire.
> “我能做的，也许还能做我做不到的事情，”医生对他的新雇员说道。

Thomas quickly became proficient at conducting the research, performing experiments on anesthetized dogs and carefully documenting their physiological reactions to trauma and shock in hopes the discoveries could save human lives. At that time, surgeons lost more patients to shock than to any other single cause.
> 托马斯很快就熟练地开展研究，对麻醉的狗进行实验，仔细记录它们在创伤和休克下的生理反应，希望这些发现能挽救人类生命。那时，外科医生因为休克失去的病人比任何其他单一原因都多。

Everything went along fine for a couple months. “We had settled down to what I considered a good working relationship,” wrote Thomas. “Then one morning it happened. Something went wrong, I no longer recall what, but I made some error. Dr. Blalock sounded off like a child throwing a temper tantrum. The profanity he used would have made the proverbial sailor proud of him.” Blalock retrieved a Coke from the lab’s walk-in refrigerator and stormed off, leaving Thomas to wonder what had just happened, and why. The technician changed out of his lab clothes and went into Blalock’s office. The doctor looked surprised, as if nothing happened.
> 一切都很顺利，持续了几个月。“我们已经安顿下来，达到了我认为良好的工作关系，”托马斯写道。“然后某天早晨发生了。出了点差错，我已记不清是什么，但我犯了一个错误。布拉洛克医生像个发脾气的孩子一样大发雷霆。他所用的脏话足以令俗话里的水手为之自豪。”布拉洛克从实验室的大冰箱里拿出一瓶可乐，气冲冲地走了，留下托马斯纳闷刚才发生了什么，以及为什么。那名技术员换下实验服走进布拉洛克的办公室。医生看上去很惊讶，仿佛什么事也没发生过。

“I told him he could just pay me off, that I was trying but that if it was going to be like this every time I made a mistake, and I couldn’t please him, my staying around would only cause trouble,” wrote Thomas. Blalock apologized. He said he lost his temper and that it would never happen again. He asked Thomas to return to work, which he did. Thomas resolved to quit if Blalock lost his cool again, as one of the other men in the lab assured him it would.
> “我告诉他可以用钱打发我走，我是在尽力，但如果每次我犯错都要这样，他就满意不了，我继续留下只会惹麻烦，”托马斯写道。布拉洛克道了歉。他说自己发了脾气，不会再发生了。他请托马斯回去工作，托马斯照做了。托马斯决心如果布拉洛克再失控就辞职，正如实验室里另一个人向他保证那样。

“But Dr. Blalock kept his word for the next 34 years, even though I made mistakes,” wrote Thomas. “We had occasional disagreements and sometimes even heated discussions. But neither of us ever hesitated to let the other know, in a straightforward man-to-man manner, what he thought or how he felt, whether it concerned research or, in later years, the administration of the laboratory. In retrospect, I think this incident set the stage for what I consider our mutual respect throughout the years.”
> “但布拉洛克博士在接下来的 34 年里信守诺言，尽管我犯过错误，”托马斯写道。“我们偶有分歧，有时甚至激烈争论。但无论是关于研究，还是后来关于实验室管理的事情，我们都从未犹豫以一种直截了当、男人对男人的方式让对方知道自己的想法或感受。回过头看，我认为这一事件为多年来我们彼此间的相互尊重奠定了基础。”

Blalock and Thomas’ partnership was far from perfect. Given the disparity in their education and status and their different races in a time of segregation, they did not receive equal acclaim or pay for work they largely shared. Throughout their collaboration, it was clear Blalock was in charge, with Thomas following. Inside the lab, however, they came to treat each other as partners in a way that was remarkable for the time.
> 布拉洛克和托马斯的伙伴关系远非完美。考虑到他们教育和地位的差距，以及在种族隔离时期不同的种族身份，他们并未因大部分共同完成的工作而获得平等的赞誉或报酬。在合作期间，显而易见的是布拉洛克掌权，托马斯在其后。然而在实验室内部，他们却以一种在当时极为罕见的方式互相视为伙伴。

For all their differences, Blalock and Thomas shared important similarities. Both were trying to redeem themselves of their own unmet expectations. Both were intensely hard workers and dedicated to the practice of medicine. Both were highly skilled practitioners, although in different and complementary ways. As the doctor became increasingly busy outside the lab, Thomas took on more responsibility. Soon he was not just preparing the animals for surgery, but conducting the complete operation.
> 尽管存在诸多差异，布拉洛克和托马斯也有重要的相似之处。两人都在努力弥补自身未能实现的期望。两人都非常刻苦工作，致力于医学实践。两人都是技术精湛的从业者，尽管方式不同且互为补充。随着这位医生在实验室外变得越来越繁忙，托马斯承担了更多责任。很快他不仅负责为动物准备手术，还能完成整个手术过程。

In 1940, Blalock was offered a job as surgeon-inchief and chairman of the department of surgery at Johns

Hopkins, the institution that left him so disappointed earlier in his life. He was getting his career back on track. “If I accept it, and I’m sure I will, I want you to go with me,” the doctor told his associate. Blalock accepted the post, and both men moved themselves and their families to Baltimore.
> 他正在让自己的职业生涯重回正轨。“如果我接受——我想我会接受——我希望你能跟我一起去，”这位医生告诉他的助手。布拉洛克接受了这个职位，两人遂携家搬到了巴尔的摩。

People at Hopkins were surprised at the degree of autonomy Thomas had. Their reaction got him thinking about his abilities and his relationship to Blalock. The other lab staff “had never heard of a surgical research technician doing what I was doing. Certainly none of the technicians at Hopkins did the work I did,” wrote Thomas. “Was my position an invention of Blalock? Was I someone he could teach to do the things he could do and maybe do things he could not do? Surely I was no robot. At what other institution would I be able to find individuals without academic degrees who would fall into my category?”
> 约翰·霍普金斯的人们对托马斯拥有的高度自主权感到惊讶。他们的反应让他开始思考自己的能力以及与布拉洛克的关系。其他实验室人员“从未听说过有外科研究技术员做我所做的事。当然，霍普金斯的技术员中也没有人做过我做的工作，”托马斯写道。“我的职位是布拉洛克发明的吗？我是他能教会去做他能做的事情并可能做他做不了的事的人吗？我肯定不是机器人。在别的机构，我还能找到没有学术学位但落入我这一类的人吗？”

Blalock left little record of his thoughts about the collaboration. It is apparent, however, that the two men came to accept - as effective partners must - the unique, potentially grating characteristics of the other. Having drawn the line at severe and profane eruptions, Thomas nonetheless had to accept that Blalock was generally reserved and unsympathetic.
> 布拉洛克几乎没有留下关于这段合作关系的想法记录。然而，很明显，两人最终像有效伙伴所必须的那样，接受了对方独特且潜在令人不快的性格特征。尽管托马斯对严重和粗俗的爆发划了界限，他仍不得不接受布拉洛克通常是冷淡且缺乏同情心的事实。

“In the operating room, Dr. Blalock was tense and impatient and, as a result, the atmosphere became tense the moment he entered,” wrote Thomas. "Even when things were progressing smoothly he would find something to

complain about. Complaining seems to be a part of him. No one ever seemed to give him sufficient assistance." This intensity made many of the staff nervous and less effective. But Thomas, knowing how deeply Blalock cared about the patients and about doing a good job, learned to deal with it. “To me,” he said, “this seemed to be his method of venting some of the pressure he was feeling.”
> 抱怨。抱怨似乎成了他的一部分。似乎没人能给他足够的帮助。” 这种强烈的情绪让许多工作人员紧张且效率下降。但托马斯知道布拉洛克对病人和做好工作的深切关心，学会了应对。“对我来说，”他说，“这似乎是他发泄所承受压力的一种方式。”

Thomas had to accept that Blalock involved himself in so much that he was often late for experiments, sometimes not showing up at all. While this confused Thomas early in their partnership, the necessity of proceeding without the doctor gave the technician greater latitude to demonstrate his abilities. “One should never try to picture the professor [Blalock] as a saint or a god; one of his chief virtues is his ‘earthly human shortcomings,’ faults that color his character and give it a spark and interest that so many men in comparable positions fail to have,” wrote one of his colleagues in 1964.
> 托马斯不得不接受布拉洛克涉入太多事务，以至于经常实验迟到，有时根本不来。虽然这在他们早期合作时让托马斯感到困惑，但在没有医生的情况下推进工作使这位技师有更大的自由度来展示自己的能力。“人们绝不应把教授[布拉洛克]想象成圣人或神；他的主要美德之一是他的‘尘世人性缺陷’，这些缺点为他的性格增添了色彩和趣味，这是许多处于类似位置的人所缺乏的，”他的一位同事在 1964 年写道。

A creature of his time, Blalock was not opposed to segregation nor struck by the irony of allowing his collaborator to moonlight as a bartender at parties he hosted. It is difficult to know what part of his imperial bearing at the beginning of the partnership was because of race and what stemmed from the traditional doctor-staff hierarchy that continues in hospitals today. Ultimately, the surgeon had to adjust his thinking about Thomas to accommodate the technician’s genius. Blatock almost certainly did not anticipate that a black man with only a high school education would be the most important collaborator in his
> 作为他那个时代的产物，布莱洛克并不反对种族隔离，也没有意识到让他的合作者在他举办的聚会上兼职当酒保这一做法的讽刺意味。很难判断在他们合作之初，他那种帝王般的态度有多少是出于种族原因，又有多少源自于至今在医院仍继续存在的传统医师与工作人员的等级观念。最终，这位外科医生不得不调整他对托马斯的看法，以适应这位技术员的天才。布莱洛克几乎可以肯定没有预料到，一个仅受过高中教育的黑人会成为他职业生涯中最重要的合作者之一。

career. But as Thomas stood up for himself and showed his abilities, Blalock found ways to increase Thomas’ pay, sought and valued his opinions, coauthored papers with him, and accepted job offers only if his technician also received employment in the deal.
> 但是，随着托马斯为自己站出来并展示出他的能力，布莱洛克想方设法提高托马斯的工资，征求并重视他的意见，与他共同署名论文，并且只有在其技术员也能在协议中获得工作时才接受工作邀请。

While the disparities in rank and prestige remained, the collaboration itself became increasingly equal. In surgeries on animals, they sometimes reversed roles, with Thomas operating and Blalock assisting. “It was extremely difficult to tell if Dr. Blalock had the original idea for a particular technique or if it was Vivien Thomas, they worked so well together,” observed another Hopkins surgeon.
> 尽管在职位和声望上的差距依然存在，但合作本身变得越来越平等。在对动物进行的外科手术中，他们有时会互换角色，由 Thomas 做手术，Blalock 协助。“很难判断某一特定技术的最初想法是出自 Blalock 医生，还是 Vivien Thomas，因为他们配合得太好，”另一位霍普金斯的外科医生观察道。

When Dr. Helen Taussig approached Blalock about the “blue babies” (children with a particular congenital heart defect) under her care, Blalock asked Thomas to join him and Taussig to discuss the possibilities. Thomas spent hours examining the preserved hearts of children who had died of the malady, looking for a way to essentially re-plumb the organ. He found a way to replicate the problem in dogs so he could then experiment with possible surgical solutions. He modified surgical instruments to fit the new procedure. Having done many surgeries on the dogs, Thomas trained Blalock on the procedure.
> 当 Helen Taussig 医生就她所照料的“蓝婴”（患有某种先天性心脏缺陷的儿童）问题找上 Blalock 时，Blalock 请 Thomas 和他以及 Taussig 一起讨论可能的办法。Thomas 花了数小时检查死于这种病症的儿童保存下来的心脏，寻找一种基本上可以重新布管该器官的方法。他找到了一种在狗身上复制这一问题的方法，以便随后试验可能的外科解决方案。他还改造了外科器械以适应新手术。在对这些狗进行了许多手术之后，Thomas 将此手术流程训练给了 Blalock。

In November of 1944, a surgical team was mobilized to conduct the first of these operations on a little girl named Eileen Saxon who was so critically ill that without the operation, she was almost certain to die. Thomas helped with the preparations but stayed behind during the surgery,
> 1944 年 11 月，一个外科团队被动员起来，在一个名叫艾琳·萨克森（Eileen Saxon）的小女孩身上实施这类手术的首次尝试。这个小女孩病得非常危重，如果不做手术，几乎肯定会死去。托马斯参与了术前准备，但在手术过程中留在了外面，

afraid his presence would make Blalock nervous. With everything in place and before proceeding, the surgeon turned to his already scrubbed and gowned chemistry technician and said, “I’d guess you’d better go call Vivien.”
> 担心他的在场会让布拉洛克紧张。把一切都准备妥当后，在继续手术之前，外科医生转向已经洗手穿好手术衣的化学技师说：“我猜你最好去叫维维恩（Vivien）来。”

Thomas went to the gallery overlooking the operating room. “Vivien, you’d better come down here,” said Blalock, positioning Thomas where he could best observe the procedure and consult with the doctor, looking over Blalock’s right shoulder. Blalock asked Thomas if the transverse incision was long enough. Yes, he said, if not too long. The two men collaborated throughout the operation.
> 托马斯来到俯瞰手术室的观礼廊。“维维恩，你最好下来一下，”布拉洛克说着，把托马斯安置在一个可以最好地观察手术并与医生商议的位置，站在布拉洛克的右肩后方。布拉洛克问托马斯横向切口是否够长。托马斯说，够了，如果不是太长的话。两人在整个手术过程中一直合作。

After an hour and a half of surgery, the clamps were finally removed. The sutures held. Taussig, standing at the head of the operating table, turned to Blalock and said, “Al, the baby’s lips are a glorious pink color.”
> 经过一个半小时的手术，夹子终于被取下。缝线稳固。陶西格（Taussig）站在手术台头部，转向布拉洛克说：“阿尔，婴儿的嘴唇呈现出一种绚丽的粉红色。”

Having accomplished the first blue baby operation, Blalock and Thomas continued their work, refining the instruments and the procedure. Many times, Blalock called for Thomas to resume his place at his right shoulder. If anyone else moved into that spot, he would tell them, “Only Vivien is to stand there.”
> 完成第一次蓝婴手术后，布拉洛克和托马斯继续他们的工作，改进器械和手术程序。多次手术中，布拉洛克叫托马斯回到他右肩的位置。如果有人占了那个位置，他会对他们说：“只有维维安能站在那里。”

Blalock’s dependence on the man he called “my superb technician,” his near-pleading that Thomas stay with him throughout his medical career, and his respectful treatment of him in a era when blacks were poorly regarded suggest Blalock more than anyone knew the value of the partnership.
> 布拉洛克对这位他称为“我出色的技师”的人的依赖，他几乎恳求托马斯在整个医学生涯中与他同行，以及在黑人备受轻视的时代对他的尊重待遇，表明布拉洛克比任何人都更懂得伙伴关系的价值。

Through his work with the doctor, Thomas went on to become an instructor to medical students at Johns Hopkins. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the institution. When it came time to decide where to put a painting of Thomas, the school announced, “We are going to hang your fine portrait with Professor Blalock. We think you ‘hung’ together and you had better continue to hang together.”
> 通过与这位医生的合作，托马斯后来成为约翰·霍普金斯医学院的医学生导师。该机构授予他名誉博士学位。当决定在哪里挂托马斯的画像时，学校宣布：“我们要把你那幅不错的画像和布拉洛克教授的并排悬挂。我们认为你们‘挂’在一起，最好继续挂在一起。”

Even if he had attended medical school, Thomas would have had difficulty making a larger mark on medicine than he did with the surgeon he came to accept as his partner.
> 即便他曾上过医学院，托马斯也很难比与他最终接受为伙伴的那位外科医生一起所做的工作在医学界留下更大的印记。

Strong partnerships don’t just fall into place when one great person happens upon another whose personality is ideal. Every collaboration is a combination of two imperfect creatures. One of the greatest challenges of any partnership is learning how to work in close quarters with another over-assuming, fallible, emotionally driven, partially informed, idiosyncratic being moving up and down on the tides of life just like you. The most successful partners come to accept the rough edges of their colleagues. The best collaborators understand they are no more going to get a perfect partner than they are going to be one, and they make accommodations for each other’s human failings.
> 强有力的伙伴关系并不是因为某个优秀的人恰好遇到另一个性格理想的人就自然而然形成的。每一次合作都是两个不完美的人凑到一起。任何伙伴关系面临的最大挑战之一，就是学会如何与另一个同样会过度自信、会犯错、受情绪左右、信息不完全、行为古怪、和你一样随生活潮起潮落的人在狭小空间内共事。最成功的合作者会接受同伴的棱角。最好的合作伙伴明白，他们不会遇到完美的伙伴，也不可能成为完美的伙伴，因此会为彼此的人性缺陷作出退让。

This element of partnership does not require you to tolerate every kind of behavior. Certain traits or habits are out of bounds. Just as Vivien Thomas refused to be berated by Alfred Blalock, no collaborator should feel an obligation
> 这一合作要素并不要求你包容所有行为。有些性格或习惯是不可接受的。正如维维恩·托马斯拒绝让阿尔弗雷德·布拉洛克对他进行辱骂一样，没有合作者应感觉有义务

to endure abuse, sloth, dishonesty, selfishness, or a partner taking sole credit for joint accomplishments.
> 忍受虐待、懒惰、不诚实、自私，或让伙伴为共同成就独揽功劳。

Beyond the universally intolerable acts, you must decide what quirks you personally cannot accept. Liv Arnesen, for example, saw little chance of working with a “publicity hound,” “a chatter-box,” or someone not prepared for the rigors of the expedition. Many people cannot abide a collaborator with an oversized ego, while some can. The tendency some people have for working right up until a deadline causes some partners great stress, while others find it invigorating.
> 除了那些普遍不可容忍的行为外，你还必须决定哪些怪癖是你个人不能接受的。例如，利夫·阿内森认为几乎不可能与“炒作狂”“话匣子”或不愿意承受探险艰辛的人一起工作。许多人无法忍受有过度自负的合作者，而有些人则可以。一些人习惯在最后期限前一直工作到最后一刻，这会让某些伙伴极度紧张，而另一些人则觉得这令人振奋。

Be careful about making your list of unacceptable traits too long. As the inventory of behaviors you won’t tolerate grows, it begins to say less about the frustrating counterparts with whom you’ve been paired and more about you being a difficult partner. Having too many conditions can rule out all your potential collaborators. If a particular attribute of your counterpart is not demonstrably wrong, it bears at least an attempt at accommodating. Thomas learned to live with Blalock’s intensity and complaining in the operating room. Frank Wells accepted many of Michael Eisner’s shortcomings. Liv Arnesen and Ann Bancroft managed to get along well in conditions that drove other polar partnerships to mutual acrimony.

> 并成为关注的中心。但与此同时，他能制造出最奇怪的方式来感到被冒犯或生气。很多时候这些表现以真正恼人的方式出现，比如提出新的合同要求或在媒体上发表令人分心的长篇指责。”

Meanwhile, Stockton was at the other extreme, legendary for keeping his emotions to himself. “Karl’s almost adolescent sense of self-esteem and egotism, I think, drove John nuts,” the journalist speculated. And yet, Stockton never voiced his irritation publicly. “I never heard him say an ill word about him. I got the feeling that John approached it as, ‘You know, that’s just Karl.’ You kind of have to cope with it for the sake of having such a good player around you.”
> 与此同时，斯托克顿则处于另一个极端，以把情绪留给自己而闻名。“我认为卡尔那近乎青少年的自尊感和自负让约翰抓狂，”这位记者推测。然而，斯托克顿从未公开表达他的恼怒。“我从没听他说过他的坏话。我感觉约翰的处理方式是，‘你知道，那就是卡尔。’为了能有这么一个优秀的队友在身边，你多少得学会应付。”

Collaborators look for ways to handle aspects of their opposites they would prefer to change. One is denial, pretending the problem does not exist. Ignoring the issue, according to psychological research, is a poor strategy that has shown itself to be “clearly related to higher levels of stress and impaired psychological well-being.” If your partner does something that bothers you, you need to recognize it before you can resolve it.
> 合作者会寻找方法来应对他们希望改变的对方特质。其中一种是否认，假装问题不存在。根据心理学研究，忽视问题是一种糟糕的策略，已被证明“明显与更高水平的压力和受损的心理健康有关”。如果你的搭档做了让你不快的事情，你需要先承认它的存在，然后才能解决它。

Another tactic is called “resigning acceptance.” This attitude, although it recognizes the problem, also includes a feeling of cynicism or powerlessness in dealing with the issue. “Typical,” say people who use this method. “These things always happen to me.” Or they may say something such as, “All my practice was for nothing. I did not need to do it at all.”
> 另一种策略称为“无奈的接受”。这种态度虽然认可问题的存在，但同时包含了玩世不恭或在处理问题上无能为力的感觉。“典型的，”使用这种方法的人会说。“这些事总是发生在我身上。”或者他们可能会说类似的话，“我所有的练习都白费了。我根本不需要去做。”

“Resigning acceptance,” wrote one group of researchers, “means abandoning outward-directed actions; however, this behavior is combined with negative expectations about the future and a loss of hope.” This kind of approach is much like denial, leading to bitterness, decreased mental health, and less control over your actions.
> “一种无奈的接受，”一组研究人员写道，“意味着放弃对外的行动；然而，这种行为同时伴随着对未来的消极期望和失去希望。”这种方式很像否认，会导致痛苦、心理健康下降以及对自己行为的控制力减弱。

The best way to deal with a frustrating situation is called “active acceptance,” neither denying the situation nor surrendering to it. “Active acceptance means acknowledging a negative, difficult situation and dealing with it in a constructive way,” wrote the researchers. “The individual dispenses with fruitless attempts to control what is neither controllable nor changeable.” Active acceptance is associated with higher levels of happiness and sense of control. In a partnership, it is epitomized by focusing on your partner’s strengths rather than her weaknesses, accepting her as she is, and being understanding when she errs. In the best collaborations, partners come to appreciate what they once found aggravating.
> 应对令人沮丧的情况的最佳方法称为“积极接受”，既不否认情况也不向其屈服。研究人员写道：“积极接受意味着承认消极、困难的处境，并以建设性的方式处理它。个人放弃对那些既不可控也不可改变之事的徒劳控制尝试。”积极接受与更高水平的幸福感和控制感相关。在伙伴关系中，它的典型表现是关注伴侣的优点而非缺点，接受伴侣本来的样子，并在她犯错时予以理解。在最好的合作关系中，伙伴会开始欣赏那些曾令他们恼火的事。

A similar phenomenon occurs with social distance. As consistently as one set of experiments shows that demographic differences between players make them less trusting of each other in the early rounds, another set of experiments just as consistently shows that the more two counterparts get to know each other, the better they coordinate their moves. The silver lining of human tribal boundaries is that they are fluid. Spend enough time working shoulder to shoulder with one of “them,”

and she will become one of “us.” We can adopt into our tribe people who are quite different from us.

Even Murphy, the curmudgeonly mystery writer who argued against writing with someone else, formed a strong partnership by ignoring his own advice. He and coauthor Richard Ben Sapir learned to deal with each other. One rewrote the other’s work without telling him. One wrecked the other’s car. They wrangled over money. They passed manuscripts back and forth on opposing sleep cycles. “We wrote and sold a lot of books, but partnership was different for us and, for the record, none of the things I just complained about [regarding partnerships] had anything to do with me and Richard Ben Sapir.”

“He had only one speed: overdrive,” wrote Murphy. “He never saved anything for later; he gave you his best work every day. Drunk, sober, happy, sad - none of it mattered. The pages flew from his typewriter.”

As correspondents for CBS Radio, they had been the best of collaborators. They accomplished groundbreaking broadcasts from pre-war Europe, most famously the first “European News Roundup,” broadcast shortly after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany. It was a journalistic and technical innovation to get voices from London, Vienna, Berlin, Paris, and Rome transmitted by shortwave to the United States. Shirer, one of the only American broadcasters in Vienna during the Anschluss, switched places with Murrow in London so he could broadcast his account without censorship.
> 作为哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）无线电的特派记者，他们一直是最佳的合作者。他们在战前的欧洲完成了开创性的广播，最著名的是在纳粹德国吞并奥地利后不久播出的首个“欧洲新闻综述”。通过短波将来自伦敦、维也纳、柏林、巴黎和罗马的声音传回美国，这在新闻和技术上都是一种创新。希勒（Shirer）是吞并时期维也纳为数不多的美国播音员之一，为了能在不受审查的情况下播报他的见闻，他与驻伦敦的默罗（Murrow）对换了岗位。

Collaborating well under such pressure built tremendous trust between the two reporters. “We have worked together
> 在如此压力下良好合作在两位记者之间建立了巨大的信任。“我们已经一起工作

very closely, Ed and I, during the last three turbulent years over here,” wrote Shirer after their last broadcast from Europe, “and a bond grew that was very real, a kind you make only a few times in your life.”
> 在过去这三年里，埃德和我在这里一起经历了非常动荡的岁月，”希勒在他们最后一次从欧洲广播后写道，“我们彼此之间建立起了一种非常真实的纽带，那是一种你一生只会建立几次的关系。

In 1947, Shirer was a commentator for CBS. But when the advertiser that sponsored his show grew dissatisfied with him, he was demoted to an unsponsored time slot. Shirer announced his resignation over the air, complaining that a “soap company can decide who cannot be on the air.” By going public, Shirer put Murrow, then a CBS executive, in the difficult spot of having to defend the integrity of the network against protestors who were siding with Shirer.
> 1947 年，希勒是哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）的评论员。但当赞助他节目的广告商对他感到不满时，他被降到了一个没有赞助的时段。希勒在广播中宣布辞职，抱怨“一个肥皂公司可以决定谁不能上广播。”希勒公开表态，使当时担任 CBS 高管的默罗陷入了尴尬境地，不得不为网络的诚信在站在希勒一边的抗议者面前辩护。

The two men met in the bar of a New York hotel to talk. “They were two old comrades with too much time spent together in the trenches to let it end this way,” wrote Murrow biographer Joseph E. Persico. “They agreed that both of them had been pressured into foolish postures.” The journalists worked out an arrangement to keep Shirer at CBS. They went to Murrow’s office and wrote a statement to give to the press. The men took it to CBS Chief Executive William S. Paley for his approval. “Bill, we have an agreement,” said Murrow.
> 两人在纽约一家酒店的酒吧里见面谈话。默罗的传记作者约瑟夫·E·佩尔西科写道：“他们是两个在战壕里共同度过太多时光的老同志，不会让事情就这样结束。” “他们一致认为两人都被迫陷入了愚蠢的姿态。” 这两位记者制定了一个安排以保留希勒在 CBS 的职位。他们去了默罗的办公室，写了一份要交给媒体的声明。两人把声明拿去请 CBS 首席执行官威廉·S·佩利审批。默罗说： “比尔，我们达成了协议。”

Paley didn’t care. “As far as I’m concerned,” he told Shirer, “your usefulness has ended. You’re out.”
> 佩利毫不在意。他对希勒说：“在我看来，你的价值已经结束了。你被开除了。”

Shirer looked to Murrow for support. Instead of backing his longtime ally, Murrow said, “We had an agreement. But if you don’t like it, Bill, you’re the boss.” Shirer felt completely betrayed.
> 希勒向默罗寻求支持。默罗没有支持他长期的盟友，而是说：“我们有个约定。但如果你不喜欢，Bill，你是老板。”希勒感到完全被出卖了。

Leaving CBS may ultimately have helped Shirer. Being off the air created the writing obsession that led to Shirer’s greatest work, his book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. “Had Mr. Shirer been broadcasting instead of researching and writing,” noted The New York Times, “that instructive book might never have come into existence.” And Shirer had, after all, resigned on the air. It didn’t matter; Murrow had lost Shirer’s trust and ignited his indignation. In his 1954 novel, Stranger Come Home, Shirer made one of the characters particularly spineless and hypocritical. It was a thinly veiled caricature of Murrow.
> 离开哥伦比亚广播公司最终可能对希勒有利。脱离播音使他陷入了写作的执念，促成了他最伟大的作品——《第三帝国的兴亡》。正如《纽约时报》指出的，“如果希勒先生当时还在播音而不是进行研究和写作，那本富有启发性的书可能永远不会问世。”而且希勒毕竟是在直播中辞职的。那并不重要；默罗已经失去了希勒的信任，并点燃了他的愤慨。在他 1954 年的小说《陌生人归来》中，希勒把其中一个角色刻画得格外懦弱和虚伪，那是对默罗的一个不加掩饰的讽刺性描绘。

Nearly two decades after the incident, Murrow, dying of cancer, requested to see Shirer. The two former allies drove around on a hot summer day near Murrow’s farm in upstate New York, Murrow sweating and coughing. “Once or twice he would try to bring up the past, but I would change the subject,” recalled Shirer. “I did not want to talk about it. It had happened. It had threatened to destroy me, but I had survived. That was that.” They returned to Murrow’s house and parted ways. Murrow died the next spring.
> 将近二十年后，那次事件过去多年，正在与癌症搏斗的默罗请求见希勒。两位昔日盟友在纽约州上州默罗的农场附近一个炎热的夏日开车兜风，默罗汗流浃背并咳嗽。“他一两次试图提起过去，但我会换个话题，”希勒回忆道。“我不想谈论它。它已经发生了。它曾威胁要毁掉我，但我活了下来。就这样。”他们回到默罗的房子后各自分开。默罗在第二年春天去世。

“Bill Shirer had tried to cut the memory out of his heart,” wrote Persico, “and forgiveness had gone with it.”
> “比尔·希勒曾试图把那段记忆从心里割除，”佩尔西科写道，“而宽恕也随之消失。”

When a partnership is going well, all kinds of wonderfully unselfish things happen. Partners change their goals to better match each other’s objectives. They strive

to be fair to each other. They focus on their counterparts’ strengths. They overlook each other’s foibles. At the zenith of collaboration, both partners make great personal sacrifices for the other’s happiness.
> 公平对待彼此。他们关注对方的长处，忽略彼此的小毛病。在合作的巅峰期，双方都会为了对方的幸福做出重大的个人牺牲。

But when things turn negative, a parallel set of emotions and reactions kicks in. The partners see themselves as pursuing opposing ends. Fairness becomes less about a considerate division of rewards and work and more about what one partner feels the other owes her. The counterpart’s strengths don’t seem so impressive any more. His personal ticks become full-fledged character flaws. At the nadir of collaboration, not only will the partners refuse to sacrifice for each other’s benefit, they eagerly go out of their way to cause their one-time comrade pain.
> 但当事情变得消极时，一系列对应的情绪和反应便会启动。伙伴们开始认为自己追求的是相互对立的目标。公平不再是对报酬和工作体贴的分配，而更多关乎一方觉得另一方欠了她什么。对方的长处看起来不再那么令人印象深刻。他的个人怪癖变成了彻头彻尾的人格缺陷。在合作的最低谷，不仅双方不会为彼此的利益做出牺牲，他们还会竭尽全力去伤害曾经的同伴。

“There will be a day of reckoning,” Terry Garnett told himself when Oracle CEO Larry Ellison fired him. Garnett eventually became chairman of Ingres, a competitor of Oracle. “I do hold grudges,” Garnett told BusinessWeek. “Am I motivated by that? Absolutely.”

The same emotional wiring that makes great partnerships so effective and rewarding creates corresponding and equally powerful negative forces if things go wrong. In a good collaboration, partners make statements such as “two heads are better than one.” In a bad one, the two make comments such as “I would have been better off working by myself” or “I wish I’d never even met him.”
> 同样的情感联结使优秀的合作关系既高效又令人满足，但如果出了问题，也会产生同样强烈且相应的负面力量。在良好的协作中，合作者会说“两个脑袋胜过一个”。在糟糕的合作中，两个人会说“我一个人做反而更好”或“真希望我从未见过他”。

Two statements in Gallup’s research differentiate good and bad partnerships on keeping the collaboration from going negative:
> 盖洛普的研究中有两句话可以区分良好与糟糕的合作关系，并决定合作是否会走向消极：

There have been times when either my collaborator or I have violated the other’s trust.
> 有时我或我的合作者曾背叛过对方的信任。

When either of us has violated the other’s trust, we have been able to forgive each other.
> 当我们中的任何一方背叛了对方的信任时，我们都能互相原谅。

Although minor disruptions occur in good and bad partnerships, serious violations of trust are rare in the best pairs. Only 18 percent of good partnerships suffer a real rift. Among poor partnerships, the number jumps to 40 percent.
> 尽管在好搭档和坏搭档之间都会出现小的干扰，但在最好的组合中，严重的信任背叛很少见。只有 18%的良好搭档会遭遇真正的裂痕。在糟糕的搭档中，这一比例跃升至 40%。

If such a breach occurs, those in a good partnership are better at working through it. When something serious enough to require forgiveness transpires, 85 percent of those in good partnerships do forgive. Those in poor partnerships patch things up only 14 percent of the time.
> 如果发生这样的裂痕，良好搭档更擅长化解。当出现足以需要原谅的严重事件时，85%的良好搭档会选择原谅。而在糟糕搭档中，只有 14%的人会修补关系。

Trust between two collaborators is like the rope between mountaineers on a snowy ledge. If the line is cut, the gravity of powerful negative emotions kicks in. The cord may have been separated one fiber at a time, as when a snide remark, showing up late for an important meeting, or letting a shared project slide a little leads to a matching dereliction from the other guy. Or it may have been sliced in two with one stroke, as Shirer felt it had when Murrow failed to back him up. In either case, the former collaborators become subject to an “irrational” desire to return wrong for wrong.
> 两位合作者之间的信任就像雪崖上登山者间的绳索。如果绳索被割断，强烈的负面情绪就会产生重力效应。绳索可能是一根一根被磨断的，就像一次讥讽、在重要会议上迟到，或让共同项目有所松懈，导致对方以相应的失责回击。也可能被一刀两断，就像希勒感觉到的那样，当默罗未能站在他那边时。他们无论哪种情况，前合作者都会受到一种“非理性”的冲动驱使，想以牙还牙。

POWER OF 2

Revenge is sweet. One brain-imaging study found that the enjoyment of striking back is processed in the same part of the brain that recognizes the pleasure of eating chocolate. The sweetest retaliation is more than a symbolic protest; it punishes the offender. Although the victim of the original offense gets nothing from the revenge except the satisfaction of seeing the other guy hurt, experiments have demonstrated that he is more than willing to pay to extract a cost from the other guy. Getting even can be as rewarding as reaching a major goal with someone else, making retribution a tempting alternative to collaboration.
> 报复是甜美的。一项脑成像研究发现，反击的快感在大脑中与品尝巧克力时的愉悦由同一部分来处理。最甜美的报复不仅仅是象征性的抗议；它还惩罚了冒犯者。尽管原始冒犯的受害者从报复中得不到除看到对方受伤的满足感以外的任何东西，实验已证明他宁愿付出代价去让对方付出代价。报复的满足感可以与与他人共同实现重大目标同样令人满足，这使得报复成为对合作的一个诱人替代。

Why would such a negative force be so powerful? Evolutionary psychologists think it stems from the need to maintain order in primitive societies. “For thousands of years, human societies did not have the modern institutions of law enforcement - impartial police and impartial judges that ensure the punishment of norm violations such as cheating in an economic exchange,” noted one set of scholars. “Social norms had to be enforced by other measures, and private sanctions were one of these means.” One economist even went so far as to call our willingness to punish bad guys “the cement of society.”
> 为什么这样一种消极的力量会如此强大？进化心理学家认为这源于原始社会维持秩序的需要。“数千年来，人类社会并没有现代的执法机构——公正的警察和公正的法官来确保对违反规范的行为如在经济交换中的作弊进行惩罚，”一组学者指出。“社会规范不得不通过其他手段来执行，私人制裁就是这些手段之一。”甚至有经济学家称我们惩罚坏人的意愿是“社会的水泥。”

We rarely admit how much we enjoy revenge. Something in our upbringing tells us it’s not right to feel that way, even though we do. But the evidence is all around. Think of how many action movies you’ve seen in which the emotional payoff at the end is seeing the bad guy get what’s coming to him. “The powerful appeal of the revenge theme in mass entertainment,” wrote one commentator, “is simply

In the movies, villains get impaled (Lethal Weapon 4), are forced out the back of an airborne plane (Air Force One), or get shot reaching for their guns (Dirty Harry). In real life, they suffer less violent but equally deserving fates.
> 在电影里，恶棍会被刺穿（《致命武器 4》）、被从飞机后舱推出去（《空军一号》），或者在伸手拿枪时被击中（《脏哈里》）。而在现实生活中，他们遭受的命运虽不那么暴力，但同样应得。

“Every time we were to meet with the CEO to present our recommendations, my boss would have me do the report and then he would put a new cover sheet on the report with his name as the author,” one volunteer told a group of researchers studying revenge. “Then, at the meeting, he would refer all of the CEO’s questions to me while taking all of the credit for the report. So, one day, I had finally had it. I did the report as requested. But on the day of the presentation to the CEO, I took a ‘holiday’ from work. At that meeting, the CEO asked my boss the questions and he could not answer any of them. The CEO investigated and my boss was fired. I was promoted to my boss’ position.”
> “每次我们要去见首席执行官汇报建议时，我的上司都会让我做报告，然后他会在报告上加一张新的封面，上面写着他的名字作为作者，”一位志愿者在给研究复仇的研究小组讲述时说。“然后在会议上，他会把首席执行官的所有问题都转向我，同时把报告的所有功劳都归于自己。于是有一天，我终于受够了。我按要求做了报告。但在向首席执行官汇报的那天，我请了‘假’不去上班。会议上，首席执行官问我上司问题，而他一个也答不上来。首席执行官展开调查，我上司被解雇了。我被提升到了我上司的位置。”

The human mind admires a good payback. “Poetic justice” occurs when it serves a larger purpose than just repaying harm inflicted on the victim, when it’s ingenious, and when it makes the offender the instrument of his own demise. “Revenge may be more aesthetically pleasing when it is not simply a repetition of the provocation,” wrote the scientists who reported the bad boss story.

Just as Shirer mocked Murrow in his novel, Michelangelo painted his critic, Vatican Master of Ceremonies Biagio da Cesena, into the Sistine Chapel, making him Minos, judge of the underworld with a large snake curled around his legs as he watches the damned arrive in Hell. It’s widely believed Jeffrey Katzenberg — of whom Disney CEO Michael Eisner once said, “I think I hate the little midget” - modeled “pushy, vain and real-estate hungry” Lord Farquaad, the villain of the movie Shrek, after his former boss.
> 正如希勒在小说中嘲弄默罗一样，米开朗基罗把他的批评者、梵蒂冈仪式长比亚乔·达·切塞纳画进了西斯廷礼拜堂，描绘他成为冥界审判官米诺斯，腿上盘着一条大蛇，正看着被诅咒的人抵达地狱。人们普遍认为，杰弗里·卡岑伯格——迪士尼 CEO 迈克尔·艾斯纳曾说过“我想我恨那个小矮子”——的前上司被用作影片《怪物史瑞克》中反派法夸德勋爵的原型，后者被塑造成“咄咄逼人、自负且贪图地产”。

The vicarious satisfaction, the smirk we get from hearing how the plagiarizing manager was exposed or how a former Disney CEO was mocked in, of all things, a children’s movie only serves to demonstrate the real temptation of what scientists call “negative reciprocity” - and its danger. The retaliation reflex may be “the cement of society,” but it fractures partnerships. Vengeful feelings quickly get out of hand. Animosity can simmer for years. “A central problem in escalating feuds is that both parties use different arithmetics to calculate the balance,” wrote the poetic justice researchers.
> 替他人得来的满足感——当听到抄袭的经理被揭发，或前迪士尼首席执行官竟在儿童电影中被嘲弄时我们露出的那种冷笑——只是说明了科学家所称的“消极互惠”的真正诱惑性——以及它的危险。报复性的本能可能是“社会的胶水”，但它会破裂伙伴关系。复仇的情绪很快失控。敌意可以潜伏多年。“在升级的宿怨中，一个核心问题是双方用不同的算术来计算彼此的收支平衡，”那些研究诗意正义的学者写道。

One of the most difficult collaborative decisions you will face is whether to patch up a partnership if your counterpart violates your trust. There is no perfect answer. Anyone who tells you to just let it go is failing to consider the intensity of his own emotions under these circumstances. Problems serious enough to require wrestling with the decision are sparked by offenses that would justify writing off your partner.
> 你将面临的最困难的合作决策之一是：如果对方违背了你的信任，是否要修补这段伙伴关系。没有完美的答案。任何告诉你就放手的人都没有考虑到自己在这种情况下情绪的强度。需要为此挣扎的严重问题，通常由足以让你将对方划为弃子的人得罪所引发。

Yet failing to continue working together can forfeit the benefits of what was otherwise a solid combination. “Some of these relationships are too good to destroy just because somebody harms us,” said Michael E. McCullough, an expert on the psychology of revenge and forgiveness. “We have to have a way of getting over the fact that we’re going to get into squabbles [and] we’re going to have conflicts of interest. Not only in the human species, but in non-human primates, you see evidence that when they harm each other they really are predisposed to try to patch those relationships back together.”
> 然而，如果未能继续合作，原本稳固的组合所带来的好处可能就会因此丧失。“有些关系太珍贵了，不能仅因为有人伤害了我们就把它毁掉，”研究复仇与宽恕心理学的迈克尔·E·麦卡洛（Michael E. McCullough）说。“我们必须学会克服将会发生争吵的事实[而且]我们会有利益冲突。不仅在人类，在非人类灵长类动物中也有证据表明，当它们互相伤害时，它们的确倾向于尝试修补那些关系。”

Common sense (confirmed in the research) indicates what needs to be done by the offender: Apologize. Make your good intentions clear. Make a peace offering. Be demonstrably more reliable to rebuild trust.
> 常识（研究也证实了这一点）指出施害者需要做什么：道歉。表明你的善意。献上和解的表示。通过更可靠的行为来重建信任。

The more intriguing question is what to do if you were the one betrayed. You need a tremendous amount of discernment, self-control, ability to give your counterpart the benefit of the doubt, and desire for a better outcome to turn a vicious circle into a virtuous one. How you manage your own thinking is as important as the offense itself. In many cases, whether a person forgives the misdeed says less about the seriousness of the wrong than about the personality of the partner whose trust was abused.
> 更有趣的问题是，如果你是被背叛的一方，该怎么办。你需要极高的洞察力、自我控制力、在对方身上给予怀疑利益的能力，以及为了更好结果而努力的愿望，才能把恶性循环转变为良性循环。你如何管理自己的思维和情绪，与侵害本身同样重要。在许多情况下，一个人是否原谅不当行为，往往与被辜负信任的伴侣的个性关系更大，而不是与错误的严重程度关系更大。

forcefully to an emotional offense, they would continue to carry unresolved feelings. “Language attests to this fact of daily observation in such expressions as ‘to give vent to one’s feeling,’ to be ‘relieved by weeping,’ etc.,” he wrote. “If the reaction is suppressed, the affect remains united with the memory. An insult retaliated, be it only in words, is differently recalled than one that had to be taken in silence … the reaction of an injured person to a trauma has really only then a perfect ‘cathartic’ effect if it is expressed in an adequate reaction like revenge.”
> 如果对一次情绪上的冒犯不加以有力的宣泄，情绪便会继续带着未解决的感受。 “语言以诸如‘发泄感情’、‘以哭来缓解’等表达证明了日常观察到的这一事实，”他写道。 “如果反应被压抑，情感便仍与记忆结合。被回敬的侮辱——即便只是言语上的——与不得不默默承受的侮辱，其记忆也不同……受伤者对创伤的反应只有在通过像复仇那样恰当的反应得到表达时，才真正具有完美的‘宣泄’效果。”

Freud’s advice has been repeated over the subsequent decades. “Punch a pillow or a punching bag. Punch with all the frenzy you can,” states a 1993 book on anger management. “If you are angry at a particular person, imagine his or her face on the pillow or punching bag, and vent your rage physically and verbally. You will be doing violence to a pillow or punching bag so that you can stop doing violence to yourself by holding in poisonous anger.”
> 弗洛伊德的建议在随后的几十年中被不断重复。“用力猛击枕头或沙袋。用你所有的疯狂去打，”一本 1993 年的愤怒管理书写道。 “如果你对某个人生气，就把他或她的脸想象在枕头或沙袋上，身体和言语上释放你的愤怒。你对枕头或沙袋施加的是暴力，这样你就能停止通过压抑有毒的愤怒而对自己施加暴力。”

There’s just one problem with this strategy: It doesn’t work. By Freud’s theory, if someone who was insulted by a colleague were to divert his anger into pounding nails for 10 minutes, he should have gotten much of the frustration out of his system. In 1959, a University of Iowa researcher tested this idea, allowing half his subjects the chance to hammer out their anger over such an insult. Then he observed as each of the volunteers got the chance to criticize the original offender. Those who spent time hammering nails were more, not less, hostile toward the person who insulted them.
> 这种策略只有一个问题：它不起作用。按弗洛伊德的理论，如果一个被同事侮辱的人把愤怒转移到用铁锤敲钉子上，持续十分钟，他应该能把大部分挫败感从体内释放出来。1959 年，爱荷华大学的一位研究者检验了这个想法，让半数受试者有机会通过敲钉子来发泄对那次侮辱的愤怒。然后他观察每位志愿者在有机会批评最初的冒犯者时的表现。那些花时间敲钉子的人对侮辱他们的人反而更有敌意，而不是更少。

In 2002, a professor at Iowa State University had hundreds of students write a brief political essay. He told them another student would comment on what they wrote, when in fact he had already prepared scathing reviews. He slammed the essays on their organization, originality, writing style, clarity, persuasiveness, and overall quality. On a scale ranging from -10 (very bad) to +10 (very good), every essay got a score between -8 and -10 . He also attached a handwritten comment to each essay that read: “This is one of the worst essays I have read!” (“Previous research has shown that this procedure makes people quite angry,” the professor added.)
> 2002 年，爱荷华州立大学的一位教授让数百名学生写一篇简短的政治论文。他告诉他们另一名学生会对他们的论文发表评论，实际上他已经准备好了严厉的评语。他严厉批评了论文的结构、原创性、写作风格、清晰度、说服力和整体质量。在从 -10（非常差）到 +10（非常好）的评分尺度上，每篇论文的分数都在 -8 到 -10 之间。他还在每篇论文上附了一条手写评论，上面写着：“这是我读过的最差的论文之一！”（教授补充道：“以往的研究表明，这种做法会让人非常生气。”）

Some of the students were given boxing gloves and a 70 -pound punching bag. They were instructed to hit it as much as they wanted while thinking of the person who criticized their essays. A picture of the purported offender’s face was shown on a computer monitor. Others were made to just sit, waiting while the experimenter pretended to be fixing their partner’s computer. Hitting the punching bag not only failed to alleviate anger and aggression, it increased the negative feelings.
> 有些学生被发了拳击手套和一个 70 磅的沙袋。他们被指示在想着批评他们论文的那个人时尽情地击打沙袋。电脑显示器上显示着所谓冒犯者面孔的照片。另一些学生则被让坐着等待，实验人员假装在修他们同伴的电脑。击打沙袋不仅未能缓解愤怒和攻击性，反而加剧了负面情绪。

“The results from the present research show that venting to reduce anger is like using gasoline to put out a fire it only feeds the flame,” wrote the professor. “By fueling aggressive thoughts and feelings, venting also increases aggressive responding. People who walloped the punching bag while thinking about the person who had provoked them were the most angry and the most aggressive.”
> “本研究的结果表明，为了发泄愤怒而宣泄情绪就像用汽油扑灭火焰——只会助长火势，”那位教授写道。“通过助长攻击性想法和情绪，发泄也会增加攻击性反应。那些在想着惹他们生气的人时猛击沙袋的人，既最愤怒也最具攻击性。”

Taken together, a number of recent studies indicate that the more one entertains the anger or recalls the bad event, the less likely it is to be resolved, and therefore the less likely the partnership will survive the rift. What the academic journals call “rumination,” what you probably call “stewing” or “fuming,” only makes things worse.
> 综合起来，近期多项研究表明，一个人越是沉溺于愤怒或回想那件不愉快的事，该事件就越不容易被化解，因此伴侣关系也越不可能在裂痕中存续。学术期刊称之为“反刍”，你们可能称之为“闷在心里”或“闷气”，只会让事情更糟。

So what should you do to get over a rough patch in your partnership? The most constructive strategies require you to find a middle ground between being aloof and submersing yourself in the emotions triggered by the event - close enough to work through the situation, far enough to avoid reliving it. Those who find this middle ground are able to evaluate the reasons why they got upset without stirring up the original emotions.
> 那么在伴侣关系出现艰难时期时，你该怎么做才能走出来？最具建设性的策略要求你在冷漠与沉浸于事件所激发的情绪之间找到一个中间地带——既要足够接近以处理问题，又要足够远离以避免重温往事。那些找到这一中间地带的人，能够在不激起原始情绪的情况下评估自己生气的原因。

One of the best ways to resolve a past problem is to find the positive in it. Shirer would have been better off thinking less about Murrow’s refusal to back him and more about how his break from CBS led him to write his best book. With his success in his new partnerships, Katzenberg is philosophical about his time with Eisner. “I had 10 great years at Disney,” he told a reporter in 2007. “I worked for Michael for 19 years and did very, very well with him. I don’t even have any bad feelings. I don’t feel any resentment. Nothing.”
> 解决过去问题的最好方法之一是从中寻找积极面。希勒若能少想默罗拒绝支持他的事，多想想与 CBS 决裂使他写出最佳著作这一点，会更好。卡岑伯格在新的合作关系中取得成功后，对与艾斯纳共事的岁月持哲学态度。“我在迪士尼度过了十年美好时光，”他在 2007 年对一位记者说。“我为迈克尔工作了 19 年，跟他一起取得了非常非常好的成绩。我甚至没有任何不好的感觉。我不感到任何怨恨。什么也没有。”

A study of 304 students who were asked to recall “a harmful thing that someone you know did to you” found that the students who were instructed to think about the upside did much better working through it. “We would like for you to write about positive aspects of the experience,” the
> 对 304 名学生进行的一项研究要求他们回忆“你认识的人对你做过的一件有害的事情”，结果发现，被指示去思考积极方面的学生在处理这件事时表现得更好。研究人员告诉志愿者：“我们希望你写下这段经历的积极方面，”

researchers told the volunteers. “In which ways did the thing that this person did to you lead to positive consequences for you? Perhaps you became aware of personal strengths that you did not realize you had, perhaps a relationship became better or stronger as a result, or perhaps you grew or became a stronger or wiser person.”
> “这个人对你做的事情在哪些方面为你带来了积极的后果？也许你意识到了一些自己未曾察觉的个人优点，也许因此使某段关系变得更好或更牢固，或者也许你因此成长，变得更坚强或更智慧。”

The students who were given this assignment found the task “remarkably easy to complete,” wrote the professors. They listed benefits such as discovering a previously unknown strength, becoming wiser and better at communicating, increased confidence, learning forgiveness, and even strengthening their relationship with the person who first aggravated them. The students who looked for benefits were more forgiving - less vengeful and less likely to avoid the offender - than other volunteers who were instructed to dwell on the offense itself in their writing.
> 教授们写道，那些被布置此任务的学生觉得这项任务“出奇地容易完成”。他们列举的益处包括发现此前未知的长处、变得更聪慧并改善沟通能力、信心提升、学会宽恕，甚至加强了与最初惹恼他们的那个人的关系。那些寻找益处的学生比被指示在写作中沉溺于冒犯本身的其他志愿者更容易宽恕——不那么报复，也不太可能回避冒犯者。

Nonetheless, it takes a rare level of maturity and selfawareness to let the trespass pass. “In a former workplace I had a chance to undermine a coworker who’d previously earned my dislike,” one reader wrote to BusinessWeek after the publication of a cover article on revenge. “Due to a computer malfunction, a 100-page document she was composing vanished. The loss guaranteed she’d never make her deadline. I watched her stress mount for a moment or two, but I couldn’t resist pointing out something she didn’t know. She’d accidentally cc’d me a recent draft of her document. Relief washed over her as she realized she’d make her deadline after all.”
> 尽管如此，要做到让侵害就此过去，需要罕见的成熟与自我觉察。一本关于报复的封面文章发表后，一位读者在写信给 BusinessWeek 时写道：“在我以前的工作单位，我曾有机会去削弱一个此前让我厌恶的同事。由于电脑故障，她正在撰写的一份 100 页文件消失了。这次损失注定她无法按时完成。我看着她的压力增加了片刻，但我忍不住指出一件她不知道的事。她不小心把她文件的一个最近草稿抄送给了我。当她意识到自己毕竟能按期完成时，顿时松了一口气。”

It took John Adams and Thomas Jefferson nearly until the ends of their lives to accomplish the reconciliation that eluded Shirer and Murrow. But once the men began their reconciliation, they made it a fitting bookend to the historic accomplishments that began their work together.
> 约翰·亚当斯和托马斯·杰斐逊几乎直到生命尽头才完成了那种雪莱和墨罗未能达成的和解。但一旦两人开始和解，他们便将其作为一个恰当的收束，与他们共同开始的历史性成就相呼应。

The two delegates to the Continental Congress were legendary collaborators on the Declaration of Independence; Jefferson was its author and Adams its leading defender in the new legislature. They were highly successful diplomatic partners representing the new country to England and France. But they created an often intense rivalry as president and vice president, and they ceased communicating for more than a decade.
> 作为大陆会议的两位代表，他们在《独立宣言》上是传奇般的合作者；杰斐逊是宣言的起草者，亚当斯则是在新立法机构中为其最坚定的辩护者。他们作为代表新生国家出使英法的外交伙伴非常成功。但在担任总统与副总统期间，他们之间产生了常常激烈的竞争，并且中断了十多年不再通信。

As the men became older, they were at risk of not patching up their relationship before one of them passed away. Then on New Year’s Day of 1812, at the urging of mutual friends, the 76 -year-old Adams wrote the letter that reestablished their partnership. He sent along some writings of his son, John Quincy Adams, certainly knowing it would tug at Jefferson’s heartstrings. “I wish you, sir, many happy New Years and that you may enter the next and many succeeding years with as animating prospects for the public
> 随着年事渐高，他们面临在一方去世之前无法修补关系的风险。后来在 1812 年元旦，在共同朋友的敦促下，时年 76 岁的亚当斯写下了那封重建他们伙伴关系的信。他随信附上了他儿子约翰·昆西·亚当斯的一些著作，无疑知道这会触动杰斐逊的心弦。“我祝您，先生，新年快乐，并愿您以目前我们面前以及未来多年同样振奋人心的公共前景，步入来年和许多随后的岁月。”那是一封简短的信，但作为信任的信号，足以弥合彼此的隔阂。

as those at present before us.” It was a short letter, but as a signal of trust, it was enough to bridge the distance.
> 那是一封简短的信，但作为信任的信号，足以弥合彼此的隔阂。

Jefferson reciprocated at length. “A letter from you calls up recollections very dear to my mind,” replied the 68-yearold Virginian. “It carries me back to the times when, beset with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right of self-government.” He closed the letter by assuring Adams that nothing had “suspended for one moment my sincere esteem for you: and I now salute you with unchanged affections and respect.”
> 杰斐逊长篇回信以示回应。“你的来信唤起我心中非常珍贵的回忆，”这位 68 岁的弗吉尼亚人答道。“它把我带回到那些困境与危险同时笼罩之时，我们同为同一事业的工人，为人类最宝贵的东西而奋斗——他治理自己的权利。”他在信的结尾向亚当斯保证，绝无事能“哪怕片刻中断我对你的真挚敬意：我现在仍以不变的深情与尊重向你致意。”

The initial exchange began a 14-year correspondence between the former presidents. They exchanged theories on the origin of Native Americans, opinions on being liberated from English dictionaries to develop an American dialect, and their separate views on social equality. They argued. They made little apologies and modest concessions. They rebuilt the trust that they could disagree without threatening the bond between them. “You and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other,” wrote Adams in July 1813.
> 最初的来往开启了两位前总统长达 14 年的通信。他们互相交流关于美洲原住民起源的理论，对摆脱英式词典束缚以发展美式方言的看法，以及他们各自对社会平等的观点。他们争论过，做过小小的道歉和谦逊的让步。他们重建了这样一种信任：彼此的分歧不会威胁到他们之间的纽带。“在我们彼此解释清楚之前，你我不该先去世，”亚当斯在 1813 年 7 月写道。

And so they did, exchanging 161 letters between them after reestablishing communication. What started as the renewal of a friendship between the two men evolved into a form of long-distance collaboration as the writing they exchanged began to accumulate into a considerable collection. In effect, they were writing their own histories and doing it together. “Both men,” observed historian Joseph
> 于是他们在恢复联系后互相交换了 161 封信。两人之间友谊的重建，逐渐演变为一种远程合作形式，因为他们互寄的文字开始积累成一笔可观的收藏。事实上，他们在一起书写着各自的历史。“两人，”历史学家约瑟夫·

J. Ellis, “knew they were sending their letters to posterity as much as to each other.”
> J.·埃利斯观察到，“知道他们把信件送给后世，就像同时寄给彼此一样。”

Just as their partnership began by collaborating on one of America’s most important historical documents, their work culminated in the creation of a vital record of two founding fathers. While their letters include news of their personal lives and the typical greetings one person sends another through the mail, they also include bits of debate, brief editorials, scientific and religious musings, and explanations of their respective rationales sprinkled with idioms and wit. Their letters make the patriots not the marble statues chiseled by the passage of time, but flesh-and-blood collaborators whose struggles can be appreciated by partners today.
> 正如他们的伙伴关系始于共同参与起草美国最重要的历史文献之一，他们的工作也以为两位开国元勋留下重要记录而告终。尽管这些信件包含了他们个人生活的消息和人们通过邮寄互致的典型问候，但信中也夹杂着辩论片段、简短的社论、科学与宗教的沉思，以及带着习语和机智的各自理由说明。这些书信使这些爱国者不再是被时间雕琢的冰冷大理石雕像，而成为有血有肉的合作者，其所经历的挣扎今天的伙伴们仍能感同身受。

The Adams-Jefferson letters present one of the best illustrations of a partnership reconciled and returned to action. They exhibit the two men’s passion for the mission that first united them - the independence and success of the United States.
> 亚当斯—杰斐逊书信集是伙伴关系和解并重返行动的最好例证之一。它们展示了两人对最初把他们团结在一起的使命——美国的独立与成功——的热忱。

Adams had enough confidence in Jefferson not to be offended when, over the course of their writing, the Virginian wrote only one letter to every two from the Massachusetts lawyer. “Never mind . . . if I write four letters to your one,” wrote Adams. “Your one is worth more than my four.” The correspondence shows a high degree of appreciation for the other’s abilities, acceptance of each other’s uniqueness, and concerns for the counterpart’s happiness. The letters reveal the men in their last years
> 亚当斯对杰斐逊有足够的信任，不会因在通信过程中这位弗吉尼亚人写的一封信顶不过马萨诸塞律师的两封而感到被冒犯。“不要紧……如果我写四封你写一封，”亚当斯写道，“你那一封的价值胜过我的四封。”这段通信显示出对彼此才能的高度欣赏、对彼此独特性的接纳，以及对对方幸福的关怀。书信揭示出两人在晚年

to be fundamentally the same people they were when younger - Adams, for example, seeking to provoke a debate and Jefferson tactfully dodging it.
> 本质上仍与年轻时相同——例如，亚当斯仍会试图激起辩论，而杰斐逊则巧妙地回避。

The letters even demonstrate an interest in how history would judge the other person. “If your objects and opinions have been misunderstood, if the measures and principles of others have wrongly been imputed to you, as I believe they have been, that you should leave an explanation of them, would be an act of justice to yourself,” Jefferson wrote to Adams in June of 1813.
> 这些信件甚至表现出对历史将如何评价对方的关切。杰斐逊在 1813 年 6 月写给亚当斯说：“如果你的目标和观点被误解，如果他人的措施和原则被错误地归咎于你，正如我相信确有其事，那你应该对它们作出解释，这将是对你自己的公正之举。”

Their exchanges are long enough to fill a book. The post-reconciliation writings between the two men are “one of the most extraordinary correspondences in American history - indeed, in the English language,” wrote historian David McCullough. “The level and range of their discourse was always above and beyond the ordinary. . . They were two leading statesmen of the time, but also two of the finest writers, and they were showing what they could do.”
> 他们的通信之多足以写成一本书。历史学家大卫·麦卡洛写道，两人和解后的来往书信“是美国历史上乃至英语世界中最非凡的通信之一。……他们讨论的层次和广度总是超出常人。……他们既是时代的两位重要政治家，也是两位最优秀的作家，他们在展示自己的才华。”

Had they not picked up their pens and dropped their grudges, American history would have been poorer. Although they corresponded heavily while diplomats in London and France, half the writing the men exchanged was after their 1812 rapprochement. The collection of letters, wrote Ellis, "is generally regarded as the intellectual capstone to the achievements of the revolutionary generation."The relationship that began in partnership, but split into mutual distrust, ended with another landmark collaboration.
> 如果他们没有放下笔和恩怨，美国历史将会黯然失色。虽然他们在伦敦和法国做外交官期间通信频繁，但两人所交换的信件有一半是发生在 1812 年和解之后。埃利斯写道，这些信件集“通常被视为革命一代成就的知识顶峰。”这段起初以伙伴关系开始、后来分裂为相互不信任的关系，最终以另一段具有里程碑意义的合作画上了句号。

On July 2, 1826, Jefferson became unconscious. He awakened briefly the next evening and asked, “Is it the Fourth?” Told it soon would be, he clung to life until the middle of the following day, exactly 50 years from the date of the Declaration of Independence.
> 1826 年 7 月 2 日，杰斐逊失去了知觉。第二天傍晚他短暂苏醒，问道：“今天是四号吗？”被告知很快就是，他便坚持活到了次日中午，恰好是《独立宣言》签署的五十周年纪念日。

That morning in Quincy, Massachusetts, as a cannon fired in the distance to mark the holiday, Adams also lay dying. Told it was the Fourth, he replied, “It is a great day. It is a good day.” Later in the afternoon, he spoke again. “Thomas Jefferson survives,” he whispered, unaware it was not true. Shortly thereafter, Adams died.
> 那天早晨在马萨诸塞州昆西，随着远处的一声礼炮为节日鸣放，亚当斯也奄奄一息。有人告诉他今天是四号，他回答说：“这是一个伟大的日子。这是个好日子。”下午晚些时候，他又说话了。“托马斯·杰斐逊还在，”他低声说道，未意识到那并非事实。不久之后，亚当斯去世了。

Six years before their nearly simultaneous deaths, with the reconciliation between them complete and the correspondence well underway, Adams was asked by his occasional secretary, Harvard student Josiah Quincy, how he could be on such good terms with someone who had been an adversary. Adams was philosophical. The differences were political, not personal. “He wished to be president of the United States, and I stood in his way,” Quincy quoted Adams as saying. “So he did everything that he could to pull me down. But if I should quarrel with him for that, I might quarrel with every man I have had anything to do with in life. And this is human nature . . . I forgive all my enemies and hope they may find a mercy in Heaven. Mr. Jefferson and I have grown old and retired from public life. So we are upon our ancient terms of goodwill.”
> 在他们几乎同时去世的六年前，和解已经完成，书信往来也已开展，他的临时秘书、哈佛学生乔赛亚·昆西曾问亚当斯：他怎么能与曾经的对手保持如此融洽的关系。亚当斯显得很豁达。这些分歧是政治上的，不是个人上的。昆西引述亚当斯的话说：“他想成为美利坚合众国总统，而我挡在他面前。所以他竭尽所能要把我拉下马。但如果我因此与他争吵，我或许也会与我一生中有过来往的每一个人争吵。这就是人性……我原谅我所有的敌人，并希望他们能够在天堂找到怜悯。杰斐逊先生和我已经年老并退出了公共生活。所以我们回到了古老的善意相待的状态。”

Captain Kim Sasse and First Officer Jonathan Palmer got along quite well. “I have a good time flying with you,” Palmer told Sasse at the controls of American Connection Flight 5966. “Yeah, me too,” said Sasse.
> 机长金·萨斯与副驾驶乔纳森·帕尔默相处得相当融洽。“和你一起飞我很开心，”帕尔默在美国连接航班 5966 的驾驶舱对掌舵中的萨斯说。“是啊，我也是，”萨斯说道。

The evening flight on October 19, 2004, was a short one from St. Louis to Adair County, Missouri. Thirteen passengers were on board, most of them medical professionals on their way to a conference. The atmosphere in the cockpit was more than relaxed. “Gotta have fun,” said Sasse.

“That’s truth, Man. Gotta have the fun,” agreed his co-pilot.
> “那是真的，伙计。一定要开心，”他的副驾驶同意道。

About 23 minutes before they were scheduled to land, the pilots heard an automated weather report from their destination that visibility was poor because of mist and a heavy overcast.

“Go all this [expletive] way,” said Palmer. “Well, let’s try it.”

“Yeah, we’ll try it,” replied Sasse. “I don’t want to go all the way out here for nothing tonight.”
> “是啊，我们试试，”萨斯回应。“我可不想白跑一趟出来。”

The rest of the flight was a mixture of good teamwork between the two pilots and the same kind of joking that occurred earlier. But while casual conversations are allowed at cruising altitude, they are specifically forbidden as the plane is descending to land. Communication is supposed to be strictly business, with specific roles, phrases, and contingencies.
> 接下来的飞行既有两位飞行员之间良好的团队合作，也有之前那种玩笑打趣。但虽然在巡航高度上允许随意交谈，飞机下降着陆时这种随意交谈是明令禁止的。通话应严格以工作为主，有明确的分工、用语和应急预案。

“We’re going into the crap,” said Sasse as they descended to the top of the clouds in the darkness.
> “我们要进那鬼地方了，”萨斯在黑暗中下降到云顶时说道。

“Look, ooh, it’s so eerie and creepy. [I] get a suffocating feeling when I see that.” Palmer made a barking sound.
> “看，哦，真是阴森又恐怖。每次看到那景象我都会有窒息感。”帕尔默发出一声犬吠般的声音。

“I’m drowning,” joked the captain.
> “我快淹死了，”机长开玩笑道。

While much of what the two men communicated followed proper procedures - the angle of the flaps, confirming the landing gear was down, conducting the prelanding checklist - they missed several crucial “callouts.” In doing so, they confused their roles and made serious errors.
> 虽然两人沟通的大部分内容都遵循了规范程序——襟翼角度、确认起落架已放下、执行着陆前检查清单——但他们遗漏了几项关键的“呼叫”。这样一来，他们混淆了各自的职责，并犯下了严重错误。

Palmer failed to announce one of the altitude thresholds and announced another incorrectly. The captain was supposed to be leveling off and monitoring the instruments while the first officer looked for the lights of the airport. Sasse was not supposed to switch from the instruments to visually guiding in the plane unless Palmer announced, “Runway in sight.” He never did. The plane was descending too fast, below the minimum altitude that Palmer should have called out to the captain. Palmer failed to challenge Sasse’s continued descent.
> 帕尔默未能宣布一个高度临界点，并且错误地宣布了另一个。机长本应保持平飞并监控仪表，而副驾驶应寻找机场的灯光。除非帕尔默宣布“跑道在视线内”，萨斯不应该从仪表转为目视引导。他却从未这么说。飞机下降得过快，低于帕尔默本应向机长呼叫的最低高度。帕尔默未能对萨斯继续下降提出质疑。

“I can see ground there,” said the pilot.
> “我能看到地面，”飞行员说。

“I can’t see [expletive],” said the co-pilot.
> “我什么都看不到（*），”副驾驶说。

The last communications between Sasse and Palmer were their panicked realizations they were about to hit the ground.
> 萨斯和帕尔默之间最后的通话，是他们惊恐地意识到飞机即将撞上地面。

“Trees!” said Palmer.

“No. Stop!” blurted out Sasse.

“Oh my God!” exclaimed the co-pilot.
> “哦我的天哪！”副驾驶惊呼道。

“Holy [expletive]!”

> “我的天哪，见鬼！”

The airplane smashed into a bean field, broke apart, and burst into flames less than two miles from the airport. Both pilots and 11 of their 13 passengers were killed.

Most of the blame was placed on Sasse for not setting the proper tone inside the cockpit. “Had he emphasized the pilots’ goals and strategies as they prepared for the [approach and landing], it is likely that the [Flight 5966] pilots would have suspended their humorous banter and engaged in only operationally relevant conversation below 10,000 feet,” stated the report.

Most collaborators, even many of the best, do not realize the role communication plays in creating a powerful partnership.

On a 1 -to- 5 scale, people in good partnerships average at least 3.6 on these statements, while excellent collaborators score a perfect 5.0. Anything below 2.0 is poor. The most successful collaborators spend enough time communicating to know what the other is thinking, and they encourage each other along the way. The implied motivations behind the messages are crucial.
> 在 1 到 5 的量表上，处于良好伙伴关系中的人在这些陈述上的平均得分至少为 3.6，而优秀的合作者得分则是满分 5.0。任何低于 2.0 的都是差的。最成功的合作者会花足够的时间交流，以了解对方在想什么，并在过程中相互鼓励。信息背后的隐含动机至关重要。

Communicating is such a major issue that experiments testing cooperation routinely prohibit the two subjects from talking, sending signals, or even seeing each other. Because the best strategy differs so much depending on whether the other person will prove to be friend or foe, our brains latch onto the slightest cues - smiles, winks, nods, or handshakes - to assess a counterpart’s trustworthiness. These little signals “provide a fast and frugal way” to get a collaboration going. According to one theory, the most cooperative people have superior emotional radar for finding others they can trust, but only if they have the chance to communicate.
> 沟通是一个如此重大的问题，以至于测试合作性的实验通常禁止两位被试交谈、发出信号，甚至见面。由于最佳策略在很大程度上取决于对方最终是朋友还是敌人，我们的大脑会抓住最微小的线索——微笑、眨眼、点头或握手——来评估对手的可信度。这些小信号“提供了一种快速而节俭的方式”来启动合作。根据一种理论，最具合作性的人拥有更敏锐的情感雷达，能够找到可以信任的人，但前提是他们有机会进行沟通。

It’s not just the content, it’s the contract that only real conversation creates. In one of the few partner’s dilemma experiments that let the players interact, volunteers were separated into four groups. In the first group, counterparts

could not communicate with each other. The second could send text messages. The third had a computer-generated voice read their messages back and forth. And in the fourth group, the subjects could hold normal telephone conversations. The closer the communication was to normal human speech, the more the two players trusted each other. Almost all of those allowed to talk by phone quickly agreed to transmit all their points to each other every round and maintained that cooperation until near the end of the game.
> 无法相互交流。第二组可以发送短信。第三组由电脑语音读出他们的消息互相传递。第四组的受试者可以进行正常的电话交谈。交流越接近正常的人类语言，两个玩家之间的信任就越强。几乎所有被允许通过电话交谈的受试者很快就同意每轮将自己的所有点数传给对方，并将这种合作保持到接近游戏结束时。

From a practical perspective, staying in contact with your partner allows the two of you to be aware of the other’s next move, to make your intentions clear, to brainstorm or perhaps stumble onto an idea you would not have had separately, and to share your candid assessments with each other.
> 从实际角度来看，与合伙人保持联系能让你们彼此了解对方的下一步动作，明确你的意图，集思广益，或许会偶然想到单独做不到的想法，并能彼此分享坦率的评估。

More important, the communication is as much a form of collaboration as the hands-on work between you and your counterpart. Although it’s unlikely you have said these things directly to your collaborator, the underlying messages of your best discussions are: “I’m trusting you with information I don’t reveal elsewhere,” “You can count on me to do what I say,” and “I will look out for you along the way.” Plans the two of you make together reinforce the idea that it is a joint project rather than the work of just one or the other.
> 更重要的是，沟通本身和你与搭档之间的实际协作工作一样，都是一种合作形式。虽然你很少会直接对合作者说出这些话，但你们最佳讨论的潜在信息是：“我在信任你，与你分享我在别处不会透露的信息”、“你可以指望我言出必行”、“在整个过程中我会为你考虑。”你们共同制定的计划进一步强化了这是一个共同项目，而不是某一方单独的工作。

Silence creates the opposite effects. You won’t look stupid if you keep quiet, and you can’t be burned with information you never reveal. Suspicious counterparts administer to themselves a sort of mental Miranda warning, worried that anything they say can and will be used against them. But whether or not you intend to do so, failing to communicate creates a threat in your partner’s mind that you are not committed to the collaboration, that you do not trust her, or that you just might make a run for the goal by yourself and claim all the credit. It’s much easier to vilify someone who has not explained his motivations, much easier to read into the silence the threat of an unpleasant surprise.
> 沉默会产生相反的效果。如果你保持缄默，你不会显得愚蠢；而你从未透露的信息也不会把你烧伤。多疑的对方会给自己施加一种心理版的米兰达警告，担心他们所说的任何话都可能被用来对付自己。但无论你是否有此意，不沟通都会在你搭档心中制造一种威胁感：你并未投入合作、你不信任她，或者你可能会独自冲向目标并攫取所有功劳。要妖魔化一个未解释其动机的人要容易得多，也更容易把沉默解读为将有令人不快的惊喜。

When former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt joined an expedition down Brazil’s River of Doubt in 1913, his group was visited one morning by three Nhambiquara Indians. “They left their weapons behind them before they appeared and shouted loudly while they were still hid by the forest,” wrote Roosevelt, “and it was only after repeated answering calls of welcome that they approached. Always in the wilderness friends proclaim their presence; a silent advance marks a foe.”

The Cuban missile crisis in 1962 not only showed how close the United States and Soviet Union could come to a nuclear war, but also the sorry state of the communication channels needed to avert it. During one point in the crisis, the Soviet ambassador to Washington had to rely on a bicycle courier to take his urgent messages for Moscow to the local Western Union office.

Thereafter, as much as the U.S. and U.S.S.R. were enemies, through better communications, they were also successful partners in keeping the Cold War cold. The two nations agreed to a “Memorandum of Understanding Regarding the Establishment of a Direct Communications Line.” Portrayed in movies as red telephones in the White House and Kremlin, the actual, more complicated connection (which connects with the Pentagon, not the White House) was instrumental in allowing both countries to signal each other during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and avoid the regional conflict becoming a global one. Several other times during the Cold War, the direct connection played a role in keeping either side from doing something that would escalate to conditions neither wanted.
> 随后，尽管美苏彼此为敌，但通过更好的通讯手段，他们也成为成功的伙伴，共同努力使冷战保持“冷”。两国达成了一份“关于建立直接通讯线路的谅解备忘录”。电影中常把它描绘成白宫和克里姆林宫之间的红色电话，但实际更为复杂的连线（与五角大楼相连，而非白宫）在 1967 年阿以战争期间发挥了重要作用，使双方能够相互发出信号，避免区域冲突演变为全球性冲突。在冷战期间的其他几次事件中，这条直接连线也在阻止任何一方采取可能导致局势进一步升级的行动方面发挥了作用。

“I have learned that it always pays to listen to other crew members,” one captain for a major U.S. airline told Gallup. “When I initially brief my first officers, I always invite their participation and encourage them to bring forward their experience. I ask them to tell me when I am in error, particularly when I am not in compliance with rules or regulations. We can disagree on politics or religion or investment strategies, but I find it to be a great advantage to harmonize cockpit views regarding our operations. The only way to do that is to respectfully invite and consider first officers’ views. God gave them brains, and I would be a fool not to avail myself of their perspectives.”

Communication in a partnership is complicated by the unique and incredible human capacity for reading into a situation what the other person must be thinking. If a chimpanzee sees a man holding a banana, the chimp will hold out its hand to beg for the food. If the man has a bucket over his head (as was done in one experiment), the chimp will still hold out its hand. The animal lacks the capacity to perceive the situation from the man’s point of view. Any human, even a child, would recognize that the man with the bucket over his head can’t see him begging.
> 在人际关系中的沟通因人类独特且惊人的能力而变得复杂——我们会把自己的想法投射到情境中，揣测对方在想什么。如果一只黑猩猩看到一个人拿着香蕉，黑猩猩会伸出手去乞讨食物。如果那个人头上套着桶（正如一项实验中所做的），黑猩猩仍会伸手。那种动物缺乏从那个人的角度感知情境的能力。任何人类，即便是孩子，也会意识到头上套着桶的人看不到它在乞求。

Scientists call it recursive thinking, the two- or threelayered awareness of what your collaborator is experiencing. A comment such as “If you’re worried that I’m all worked up about it, don’t sweat it. We’re cool” is loaded with recursion, but partners can untangle this back-and-forth reasoning quite easily. “Recursion,” concluded a psychology professor from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, “is a ubiquitous property of the human mind and possibly the principal characteristic that distinguishes our species from all other creatures on the planet.”
> 科学家称这种能力为递归思维，即对合作者所经历之事的两层或三层意识。像“如果你担心我为此太激动了，别烦，没事的，我们没事”的一句话就充满了递归，但合伙人很容易理顺这种你来我往的推理。一位来自新西兰奥克兰大学的心理学教授总结道：“递归是人类思维的普遍特性，可能是区分我们物种与地球上所有其他生物的主要特征。”

Recursive thinking is a double-edged sword. There is no sympathy without recursion. A great partner who understands that his colleague is struggling will shoulder more of the burden and offer his support. It’s impossible to understand how a collaborator’s desire for the goal differs from your own unless you can mentally put yourself in his shoes.
> 递归思维是一把双刃剑。没有递归就没有同情。一个明白同伴在挣扎的优秀伙伴会承担更多负担并提供支持。除非你能在心理上设身处地替他着想，否则不可能理解合作者对目标的渴望与自己的差异。

Yet too much recursion and too little discussion inevitably lead to wrong assumptions. Rather than explain their rationale, collaborators routinely assume the other person knows the reasons. Rather than compliment the other person on a good job, partners assume their praise would be redundant. Rather than ask for more information and listen closely, people assume they already know what the other person would say.
> 然而，过度递归而缺乏沟通不可避免地导致错误的假设。合作者常常不解释他们的理由，而是默认对方知道原因。合作者也常常不去表扬对方的出色工作，而是假定自己的赞美是多余的。人们也常常不去询问更多信息并认真倾听，而是自以为已知对方会说什么。

Assuming without verifying is dangerous. We are not mind readers; we are mind guessers. Sometimes we guess wrong. This is the reason why in partnerships that involve a risk of death - such as piloting an airplane, rock climbing, and scuba diving - the most important messages are mandated and standardized to remove any ambiguity.

At the Play It Again Sports store in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada, the managers and staff would commonly refer to each other as “kemosabe,” a term introduced by the American radio and TV series The Lone Ranger. Part-owner Trevor Muller and his father, who sometimes helped out in the store, called each other “kemosabe” throughout their lives. It came to be a friendly greeting in the store between any two people, whether they were managers, employees, or customers.

“Kemosabe” was a term Tonto first called his partner. Where the scriptwriters got the word is unclear, and its precise meaning varies somewhat in the series. In the pilot episode of the TV series, Tonto says it means “trusty scout.” In another episode, Tonto says it means “trusty friend.” Although Tonto most often uses the term, sometimes the Lone Ranger uses it in return. “At no time during the episodes reviewed by this inquiry was the term ‘kemosabe’ ever used in a demeaning or derogatory manner or in any way that might be construed as a racial slur,” stated the ruling.
> “Kemosabe”是顿托最先用来称呼他的搭档的词。剧本作者从何处得来这个词不得而知，其确切含义在剧集中有所不同。在电视剧试播集中，顿托说它的意思是“忠实的侦察员”。在另一集里，顿托说它的意思是“忠实的朋友”。尽管顿托最常使用这个词，有时独行侠也会回以此称呼。“在本次审查所观看的所有剧集中，‘kemosabe’一词从未以贬损或侮辱的方式使用，也未以任何可能被解读为种族性诽谤的方式出现，”裁决书写道。

“Tonto is the Lone Ranger’s partner and friend,” the judge determined. “He is clean cut, well groomed and although he speaks a form of broken English, he is neither dumb nor stupid. To the contrary, his role is to uncover many of the clues upon which the Lone Ranger’s strategy is developed.” The two men treat each other with respect, and while Native Americans, including Tonto, are often treated in a demeaning manner, the Lone Ranger never treats his counterpart poorly, the review determined. Moore’s lawsuit was dismissed, and the decision was upheld by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal.
> “顿托是独行侠的搭档和朋友，”法官裁定。“他仪表整洁，打理得当，尽管他说的是一种蹩脚的英语，但他既不愚笨也不笨拙。相反，他的角色是揭示许多线索，从而构成独行侠策略的基础。”审查认为，两人彼此尊重，尽管包括顿托在内的美洲原住民常常被以贬损的方式对待，但独行侠从未对他的搭档苛待。穆尔的诉讼被驳回，该决定被新斯科舍省上诉法院维持。

Francis Crick was an English physicist whose interests veered toward biology. At an early age Crick shunned religion for science, which he found more insightful. His doctoral studies in physics stopped when a land mine destroyed his research on the viscosity of water at high pressure and temperature, what he later called “the dullest problem imaginable.” From his experience with physics he had acquired “the hubris of the physicist, the feeling that physics as a discipline was highly successful, so why should not the other sciences do likewise?” He found the certainty of physics to be an antidote to what he perceived as “the rather plodding, somewhat cautious attitude” of biologists.

Watson and Crick met in October 1951, when Watson joined the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Crick was already working. They clicked immediately. Within half an hour, they were discussing the possibility of finding the structure of DNA. “From my first day in the lab I knew I would not leave Cambridge for a long time,” wrote Watson. “Departing would be idiocy, for I had immediately discovered the fun of talking to Francis Crick.”

To solve the puzzle required a tremendous amount of conjecture. The ability to bounce ideas off each other proved to be the principal strength of the collaboration between Crick and Watson. The American admired that Crick “never stops talking and thinking.” The two men ate lunch together almost every day. Afterward, they would exchange ideas while strolling along the grounds. They shared coffee in the mornings and tea in the afternoons. When the group in Cavendish was offered an extra room, two of Watson and Crick’s colleagues announced they were going to give it to them “so that you can talk to each other without disturbing the rest of us.”
> 为了解开这一谜题，需做大量的推测。互相碰撞想法的能力被证明是克里克与沃森合作的主要优势。那位美国人佩服克里克“从不停地说话和思考”。两人几乎每天一起吃午饭。随后，他们会在庭院散步时交换想法。早晨他们一起喝咖啡，下午喝茶。当卡文迪许的小组被提供一间额外的房间时，沃森和克里克的两位同事宣布要把房间让给他们，“这样你们就可以互相谈论而不打扰我们其他人。”

The bluntness of their exchanges made them productive. “By collaborating, if one of us got on the wrong track, one of us could get us out of it,” Crick reminisced to Watson in a 1973 conversation. If one of them was convinced of a particular theory, the other would play devil’s advocate to ensure they reached the right conclusion. “The other thing good about our collaboration was that we weren’t the least bit afraid of being candid to each other, to the point of being rude,” said Crick. "If you have constant interchange and chatting together and saying what you think of the other person’s ideas to their face, I know that you can solve problems of this kind."The combination, as one colleague put it, was "that marvelous

At about the same time Watson and Crick were hitting it off, the pair that might have beaten them to the finish line got off on the wrong foot, never to recover. Rosalind Franklin, an expert in X-ray techniques, joined King’s College in January 1951. She and Maurice Wilkins, already at King’s, could well have discovered the structure of DNA had they communicated better.
> 就在沃森和克里克走到一起的时候，可能本可以先他们一步完成任务的一对人却一开始就搞砸了，从此一蹶不振。罗斯琳德·富兰克林是 X 射线技术方面的专家，1951 年 1 月加入了国王学院。她和已经在国王学院的莫里斯·威尔金斯本可以通过更好的交流发现 DNA 的结构。

“There isn’t a first-class or even a good brain among them - in fact nobody with whom I particularly want to discuss anything, scientific or otherwise,” Franklin wrote to a friend in Paris. At one point, she ordered Wilkins to stop his work on DNA. “Go back to your microscopes,” she told him. At another, when Wilkins offered an insight, she ripped into him: “How dare you interpret my data for me!” Although Wilkins made overtures to Franklin, such as giving her a box of chocolates, she refused to work with him during the two crucial years when the discovery was within their reach. The acrimony became so bad that the head of the lab had to divide the instruments and DNA samples between them so they could work separately.
> “他们当中没有一个是头脑一流的，甚至没有一个是好的——实际上没有谁是我特别想讨论任何事情的，无论是科学上的还是其他方面的，”富兰克林写信给她在巴黎的一个朋友。有一次，她命令威尔金斯停止对 DNA 的研究。“回去做你的显微镜活吧，”她对他说。还有一次，当威尔金斯提出一个见解时，她冲他发火：“你怎么敢替我解读我的数据！”尽管威尔金斯曾向富兰克林示好，比如送她一盒巧克力，但在发现近在咫尺的两个关键年份里，她拒绝与他合作。双方的敌意变得如此严重，以至于实验室负责人不得不把仪器和 DNA 样本分开给他们各自，以便他们分别工作。

Crick and Watson made numerous mistakes along the way, giving little hint their exchanges would lead to a breakthrough. A visiting biochemist from Columbia University considered Watson “undeveloped,” while Crick produced only “occasional nuggets glittering in the turbid

> 喋喋不休的喧嚣。” 他总结道，“这是典型的英国知识分子氛围，做的事少，说的多。”

Franklin eventually announced she was leaving King’s College. Shortly before she left, Watson traveled to King’s to visit Wilkins. Finding Wilkins busy, he walked down the hall to Franklin’s lab. The door was ajar, and he walked in, finding her bent over an X-ray photo she was measuring. “Momentarily startled by my entry, she quickly regained her composure and, looking straight at my face, let her eyes tell me that uninvited guests should have the courtesy to knock,” Watson recalled. As he began discussing his theories about DNA with Franklin, she became increasingly annoyed until the discussion turned into an argument.
> 富兰克林最终宣布要离开国王学院。在她离开前不久，沃森前往国王学院拜访威尔金斯。见威尔金斯正忙，他便走到走廊尽头到富兰克林的实验室。门半开着，他走了进去，看到她弯腰在测量一张 X 光照片。“我突然闯入令她微微吃惊，但她很快恢复了镇定，直视着我的脸，用眼神示意不速之客应有礼貌先敲门，”沃森回忆道。当他开始与富兰克林讨论他关于 DNA 的理论时，她变得越来越恼火，直到讨论演变成争论。

“Rosy by then was hardly able to control her temper, and her voice rose as she told me that the stupidity of my remarks would be obvious if I would stop blubbering and look at her X-ray evidence,” wrote Watson. Implying Franklin didn’t know how to read the photos she was taking, he told her she needed to learn the theory of molecular structure to understand why her work did not disprove Watson’s position. “Suddenly Rosy came from behind the lab bench that separated us and began moving toward me,” wrote Watson. “Fearing that in her hot anger she might strike me, I . . . hastily retreated to the open door” just as Wilkins was poking his head into the room.
> “到那时，罗茜几乎控制不住自己的脾气，她提高了声音，告诉我如果我别再哭哭啼啼、看看她的 X 光照片，就能看出我那些话是多么愚蠢，”沃森写道。他暗示富兰克林不知道如何阅读自己拍的照片，告诉她她需要学习分子结构理论，才能明白她的工作为何不能推翻沃森的观点。“突然，罗茜从把我们隔开的实验台后面走出来，开始向我走来，”沃森写道。“担心她在盛怒之下会打我，我……匆忙退到了敞开的门口”，正好那时威尔金斯把头伸进了房间。

imagine the emotional hell he had faced during the past two years, he could treat me almost as a fellow collaborator rather than as a distant acquaintance with whom close confidences inevitably led to painful misunderstandings,” wrote Watson.
> 想象一下他在过去两年里所经历的情感地狱，瓦森写道，他几乎可以把我当作一个合作者，而不是一个与之交心必然导致痛苦误解的疏远熟人。

They began to discuss DNA. Wilkins mentioned that Franklin’s photos, which had been turned over to him in preparation for her leaving, showed a particular pattern for the structure of DNA. Watson asked what the pattern looked like. Wilkins went in the next room and retrieved one of the clearest photos.
> 他们开始讨论 DNA。威尔金斯提到，弗兰克林的一些照片在她离开前已交给他，这些照片显示了 DNA 结构的特定模式。沃森问这种模式看起来如何。威尔金斯走到隔壁房间，拿出了一张最清晰的照片。

“The instant I saw the picture my mouth fell open and my pulse began to race,” wrote Watson. Thoughts clicked that, in hindsight, Crick and Watson could have seen earlier, but didn’t.
> “我一看到那张照片，嘴就张开了，脉搏开始加速，”沃森写道。事后看来，克里克和沃森本可以更早看出的想法一下子触动了他们，但当时并没有。

With new information and new urgency, Crick and Watson returned to their model building. First Crick worked through a problem that defied Watson. While Watson was playing tennis one afternoon, Crick rebuilt the model to the new specifications so the double helix had the right amount of twist. He attached a note for his collaborator: “This is it - 36 degrees rotation.”
> 在获得新信息并感到紧迫之后，克里克和沃森重新回到模型构建上。首先是克里克解决了一个困扰沃森的问题。一天下午沃森去打网球时，克里克按新的规格重建了模型，使双螺旋具有正确的扭转角。他在模型上留了一张纸条给合作者：“就是这个——36 度旋转。”

Picking up where Crick left off, Watson cut cardboard pieces to represent the molecules in the middle of the double helix. Suddenly, as he tried to fit the pieces to each other, he noticed something crucial: When two of the four kinds of molecules were matched, they made the same shape as when the remaining two kinds of molecules were combined. DNA
> 从克里克停下的地方接着，沃森剪下纸板片来表示双螺旋中间的分子。突然，当他试图把这些片拼到一起时，他注意到一个关键点：当四种分子中的两种配对时，它们的形状与剩下两种分子结合时的形状相同。DNA

looks a little like a spiral staircase. Watson had just discovered how equal-sized stairs were made throughout the helix. By putting their heads together and playing with puzzle pieces, Crick and Watson had discovered the key to how the pattern of life is passed from one generation to the next.
> 看起来有点像螺旋楼梯。沃森刚刚发现了整个螺旋中等大小台阶是如何形成的。通过集思广益并玩拼图，克里克和沃森发现了生命模式如何从一代传到下一代的关键。

Neither man was eager to tell Wilkins. Just as the two partners finished adjusting the angles and distances in their model of DNA, a letter arrived from Wilkins, welcoming collaboration. “I think you will be interested to know that our dark lady leaves us next week,” Wilkins wrote to Crick. “I am now reasonably clear of other commitments and have started up a general offensive on Nature’s secret strongholds…At last the decks are clear and we can put all hands to the pumps! It won’t be long now.” Crick was looking at the model as he read his friend’s letter.
> 两人都不愿意把这事告诉威尔金斯。就在两位合作者把他们的 DNA 模型的角度和距离最后调整好时，威尔金斯来信，表示愿意合作。威尔金斯写给克里克：“我想你会感兴趣地知道，我们的那位‘黑衣女士’下周就要离开我们了。我现在算是摆脱了其他牵挂，已经开始对大自然的秘密要塞发起全面攻势……甲板总算清理完毕，我们可以全力以赴了！不会太久的。”克里克一边读着朋友的信，一边看着模型。

Much has been made of Wilkins showing Franklin’s X-ray photo to Watson. Some say she was robbed of her achievement. Others point out that she built on Wilkins’ work and had turned it back over to him. Some say it was an improper breach. Others argue that the photo had already been revealed in public meetings. Rarely discussed, however, is how Franklin’s refusal to collaborate, freshly punctuated by her angry exchange with Watson, almost certainly cost her the respect, professional courtesy, and credit many commentators say she deserved. Through her irascibility and go-it-alone attitude, Franklin’s wound was largely selfinflicted, and she became less a scientific pioneer than a cautionary tale.
> 关于威尔金斯把富兰克林的 X 光照片展示给沃森，外界议论甚多。有人说她的成就被窃取。也有人指出，她是在建立在威尔金斯工作基础上，并且已将其交还给他。有人称这是不当的泄露。还有人认为那张照片已经在公开会议上被展示。很少有人讨论的是，富兰克林拒绝合作——并且因与沃森的激烈争执而显得更为明显——几乎可以肯定地使她失去了许多评论者认为她应得的尊重、职业礼遇和应有的荣誉。由于她的易怒和独来独往的态度，富兰克林的伤害在很大程度上是自招的，她也因此从一位科学先锋变成了一个警示性的典型。

In 1953, Watson and Crick submitted their breakthrough to the British journal Nature. In one of the greatest understatements ever published, the men began their paper: “We wish to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid (D.N.A.). This structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest.” To determine whose name would appear first on the paper, they flipped a coin. The two men invited Wilkins to add his name to the paper, but he declined.
> 1953 年，沃森和克里克将他们的突破性成果投稿给英国期刊《自然》。在已发表的最含蓄的陈述之一中，两人在论文开头写道：“我们想提出脱氧核糖核酸（D.N.A.）盐的一种结构。该结构具有一些新的特征，具有相当重要的生物学意义。”为了决定谁的名字排在论文首位，他们掷了硬币。两人曾邀请威尔金斯在论文上署名，但他婉拒了。

In 1962, all three men shared the Nobel Prize for medicine for their DNA work. Franklin was not considered, as she died in 1958, and Nobel rules forbid posthumous awards. Substantial conjecture surrounds the question of whether she would have been honored had she been alive.
> 1962 年，三位男科学家因他们在 DNA 方面的工作共同获得了诺贝尔医学奖。弗兰克林并未被考虑在内，因为她于 1958 年去世，而诺贝尔规则禁止追授。关于如果她还活着是否会被授奖，存在大量推测。

The larger question revolves around what she and Wilkins might have accomplished if they had worked together. “It was a pity that Rosalind and I did not spend more time discussing the importance of her discovery and what it might tell us about the structure of DNA,” Wilkins wrote in his autobiography. He questioned what he might have done differently. Perhaps he should have asserted himself more, he speculated. “It may seem amazing that at the time neither of us saw the obvious explanation,” wrote Wilkins. “If she and I had discussed the problem there would have been little to prevent us finding the Double Helix.”
> 更大的疑问在于如果她和威尔金斯一起合作，他们会取得怎样的成就。威尔金斯在自传中写道：“遗憾的是我和罗莎琳德没有花更多时间讨论她发现的重要性以及它可能告诉我们的 DNA 结构。”他质疑自己本可以做出哪些不同的选择。他推测也许自己本应更坚定一些。“当时我们俩都没有看到那个明显的解释，这或许令人惊讶，”威尔金斯写道。“如果她和我讨论过这个问题，几乎没有什么可以阻止我们发现双螺旋结构。”

“I’ve always hated the danger part of climbing, and it’s great to come down again because it’s safe. But there is something about building up a comradeship - that I still believe is the greatest of all feats - and sharing in the dangers with your company of peers. It’s the intense effort, the giving of everything you’ve got. It’s really a very pleasant sensation.”

Ernest Shackleton, Frank Wild, and their two fellow explorers were starving. Three weeks earlier, they reached closer to the South Pole than men had ever traveled before. They turned back in a desperate race against starvation and the scheduled departure of a ship waiting for them on the edge of the Antarctic continent.
> 欧内斯特·沙克尔顿、弗兰克·怀尔德以及他们的两位同伴当时正处于饥饿之中。三周前，他们到达了比人类此前任何时候更接近南极点的地点。他们在与饥饿和一艘在南极洲边缘等候他们的船预定离开时间的绝望竞赛中折返。

They were working their way between food depots set up for their return journey. Several times, they ran out of food before finding the next depot. At one point, the team had only enough biscuits to ration one in the morning to each man.
> 他们当时正沿着为返程设立的食物补给点之间穿行。几次，他们在找到下一个补给点之前就把粮食吃光了。有一次，队里只剩下足够每人早晨分一块饼干的配给。

> 力量的两倍

Wild was ill and extremely weak, unable to eat the dried meat and lard mixture that was the staple of the expedition. He devoured his single biscuit. As they set out to find the next cache of food, Shackleton took his biscuit and put it in Wild’s pocket.
> 怀尔德病得很重，极度虚弱，无法吃那种干肉和猪油混合物——这是此次探险的主食。他把仅有的一块饼干狼吞虎咽。就在他们出发去寻找下一处食物储藏点时，沙克尔顿把自己的饼干拿走并放进了怀尔德的口袋里。

“What’s that, Boss?” asked Wild.
> “那是什么，老大？”怀尔德问道。

“Your need is greater than mine,” said the leader.
> “你的需要比我的更大，”领队说。

Wild was so awe-struck that he underlined every word of the story when he recounted it in his journal: “S[hackleton] privately forced upon me his one breakfast biscuit, and would have given me another tonight had I allowed him. I do not suppose that anyone else in the world can thoroughly realize how much generosity and sympathy was shown by this; I do, and by God I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit.”
> 怀尔德当时震惊得不知所措，以至于在日记中复述这个故事时把每个字都加了下划线：“[沙克尔顿]私下把他的一块早餐饼干强加给我，今晚若我允许他还会再给我一块。我想没有其他人能彻底体会到这份慷慨和同情；我能体会，靠上帝我永远不会忘记。成千上万英镑也买不到那一块饼干。”

With the nourishment of the biscuit, Wild was able to go on, and through the fortunate discovery of each of the food stores along the way, to regain his strength. He vowed never to return to Antarctica.
> 靠着那块饼干提供的营养，怀尔德得以继续前进，并且通过沿途幸运地发现每一处食物储备，他恢复了体力。他发誓再也不回南极了。

His resolve did not last long. “On the return journey, while sharing a tent with Shackleton, he asked me if I would join him on another attempt at the Pole,” wrote Wild. "One of my diary entries reads like this: "This trip has completely cured me of any desire for further polar exploration. Nothing will ever tempt me to face that awful glacier and terrible plateau again.’ However, so great was my
> 他的决心没坚持多久。怀尔德写道：“在归途中，与沙克尔顿同帐篷时，他问我是否愿意和他再去一次争夺南极点。我的一篇日记是这样写的：‘这次旅行彻底治好了我对进一步极地探险的任何渴望。再也没有什么会诱使我去面对那可怕的冰川和可怖的高原。’然而，我的渴望却如此之…… ”

regard for the ‘Boss’ that without any hesitation I replied, ‘Yes!’ We then went on to discuss details.’
> 当被问及是否尊重“老板”时，我毫不犹豫地回答：“是的！”然后我们继续讨论细节。

Five years later, Shackleton led the voyage of the Endurance, a ship that was crushed in ice, forcing the men on a heroic journey to an uninhabited island and an improbable rescue of every crew member. The journey made Shackleton famous, and it led to generations studying his leadership abilities.
> 五年后，沙克尔顿率领“毅力号”航行，该船被冰压碎，迫使这些人在一次英雄般的旅程中前往无人岛，随后不可思议地救回了每一名船员。那次旅程使沙克尔顿成名，并引发了后世对其领导能力的研究。

Because of the trust built during the earlier expedition, Wild was Shackleton’s second in command on the Endurance; he was the one Shackleton entrusted with the care of most of the men as the leader and five others went for help in a small boat. “Wild never forgot the private act of kindness” with the biscuit, wrote author Caroline Alexander, “and his adamantine loyalty to Shackleton would prove to be one of the expedition’s major assets.”
> 由于在早期探险中建立的信任，怀尔德在“毅力号”上担任沙克尔顿的副手；当沙克尔顿和另外五人乘小艇去寻求帮助时，他被托付照料大多数人。“怀尔德从未忘记那次递饼干的私人善举，”作者卡罗琳·亚历山大写道，“他对沙克尔顿那坚如磐石的忠诚，证明是这次探险的一大资产。”

The sacrifices some partners make for each other don’t make sense. A partnership is based on the assumption that by working together, both people will achieve heights neither could have accomplished alone. You and your collaborator are supposed to be better off than you would be without the working relationship. While looking out for the other person creates trust, endangering your life for him seems to miss the point. What good is a partnership to a person who gets himself killed for someone else?
> 有些伴侣为彼此付出的牺牲让人无法理解。伙伴关系建立在这样的假设之上：通过合作，双方都能达到各自单独无法实现的高度。你和合作者应当比没有这段工作关系时处境更好。虽然关照对方能建立信任，但为他冒着生命危险似乎背离了初衷。对为他人送命的人来说，伙伴关系还有什么意义呢？

POWER OF 2

> 力量之二

Since Charles Darwin published On the Origin of the Species in 1859, the scientific yardstick by which all behaviors have been judged is their effect on the survival of a creature or its family. Habits, instincts, or biases that reduce the risk of death, increase the odds of reproducing, or serve to protect a person’s children are behaviors that are more likely to continue and spread through succeeding generations. From an evolutionary perspective, looking out too much for the other guy, unless it helps you or your family, is counterproductive. True altruism is not sustainable, according to these theories, because it doesn’t get passed on as well as more selfish tactics.
> 自从查尔斯·达尔文在 1859 年出版《物种起源》以来，科学衡量一切行为的标尺就是它们对个体或其家庭生存的影响。那些能减少死亡风险、增加繁殖几率或保护后代的习惯、天性或偏好，更有可能延续并在后代中传播。从进化的角度看，过度为他人着想——除非对你或你的家庭有利——就是适得其反。根据这些理论，真正的利他主义不可持续，因为它不像更自私的策略那样容易被传承下去。

This doesn’t mean it never makes sense to collaborate. Darwin himself postulated that teamwork was a superior biological trait. “When two tribes of primeval man, living in the same country, came into competition, if (other circumstances being equal) the one tribe included a great number of courageous, sympathetic and faithful members, who were always ready to warn each other of danger, to aid and defend each other, this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other,” he wrote. “The advantage which disciplined soldiers have over undisciplined hordes follows chiefly from the confidence which each man feels in his comrades… Selfish and contentious people will not cohere, and without coherence nothing can be effected. A tribe rich in the above qualities would spread and be victorious over other tribes.”
> 这并不意味着合作从未有意义。达尔文本人就假设团队合作是一种优越的生物特征。他写道：“当两个原始部落生活在同一地区并相互竞争时，如果（其他情况相同）其中一个部落包含大量勇敢、富于同情心且忠诚的成员，他们总是准备相互警告危险、互相援助和防卫，那么这个部落会更成功并征服另一个部落。”“纪律严明的士兵相对于无纪律的暴徒的优势主要源于每个人对战友的信任……自私和好争的人不会团结，而没有团结则无所作为。一个富有上述品质的部落会扩张并战胜其他部落。”

Using Darwin’s rationale, scientists are not impressed by most partnerships. They usually find some way to
> 按照达尔文的推理，科学家们对大多数伙伴关系并不感到印象深刻。他们通常能找到某种方式来

explain that what appears to be unselfishness on the surface pays off for the one who did the good deed. “Instrumental reciprocity,” they call it - a means to a self-serving end: If I can keep my partner happy, he’ll do what I need him to do for me. It’s nothing more than a deal, a mutually beneficial arrangement.
> 解释起来，那些表面上看似无私的行为最终会让行善者获益。他们称之为“工具性互惠”——通向利己目的的手段：如果我能让我的伙伴满意，他就会为我做我需要他做的事。这无非是一笔交易，是一种互利安排。

Some believe human nature works against every behavior that cannot ultimately be traced to a genetically selfish reason. “Be warned,” wrote Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene, “that if you wish, as I do, to build a society in which individuals cooperate generously and unselfishly towards a common good, you can expect little help from biological nature.”
> 有人认为，人性会反对任何不能最终追溯到基因自私原因的行为。理查德·道金斯在他的《自私的基因》一书中写道：“要当心，如果你像我一样，希望建立一个个体为了共同利益慷慨无私地合作的社会，那么你不应指望生物本性会给予多少帮助。”

Instrumental reciprocity is common and can be quite constructive. Much of this book describes how the right partnerships, properly managed, create the optimal strategy for your success. All partnerships begin as instrumental agreements. In the early stages, they could even be called mutually selfish. For many collaborations, this coming together so that both partners go away richer is enough to carry the partnership all the way to the goal.
> 工具性互惠很常见，也可以相当有建设性。本书的大部分内容都在描述，合适的伙伴关系在恰当管理下，如何为你的成功创造最佳策略。所有伙伴关系都始于工具性的协议。在早期阶段，它们甚至可以被称为互相自利。对于许多合作来说，这种结合使双方都变得更富足，就足以将伙伴关系一直推进到目标。

But then there's that biscuit.
> 但随后就出现了那块饼干。

Why would Shackleton endanger himself to feed his partner? Why would Wild sign on for another expedition on which he nearly died? Why do soldiers sometimes sacrifice their lives for their unrelated comrades? Why do the selfish gene’s greatest defenders revolt at its Hobbesian cruelty? “My own feeling,” wrote Dawkins, "is that a human

society based simply on the gene’s law of universal ruthless selfishness would be a very nasty society in which to live." It is difficult to write off selfless acts as simply the irrational tactics of people who don’t understand how the game should be played.
> 仅仅基于基因那条“普遍无情自私”法则的社会，将是一个极其糟糕的生活环境。很难把无私行为一概归结为那些不懂得如何玩这场游戏的人所采用的非理性策略。

Three statements about unselfishness from Gallup’s research proved to be the ultimate measures of the strength of a partnership:
> 盖洛普研究中关于无私的三句话被证明是衡量伙伴关系强度的终极标准：

We take as much satisfaction at seeing the other succeed as we do from our own success.
> 看到对方成功时我们会像看到自己成功一样感到满足。

My partner will risk a lot for me, and I will do the same for him or her.
> 我的合伙人会为我冒很大风险，我也会为他或她做同样的事。

My partner is like a brother or a sister to me.
> 我的合伙人对我就像兄弟或姐妹一样。

Good working relationships average at least 3.3 on these statements on a 1 -to- 5 scale. Those in excellent partnerships strongly agree with all three statements. As extreme as the final statement is, the question of whether you have formed a fraternal bond with your counterpart discriminates between successful and poor alliances better than any of the other statements Gallup tested. It raises fascinating questions about how humans blur the genetic boundaries for those they have come to know well and regard highly in a major endeavor.
> 良好的工作关系在这些陈述上平均得分至少为 3.3（以 1 到 5 的量表计）。那些处于卓越伙伴关系的人对这三条陈述都强烈赞同。尽管最后一条陈述有些极端，但关于你是否与对方形成了兄弟姐妹般的纽带这一问题，比盖洛普测试的任何其他陈述都更能区分成功与失败的联盟。它引发了一个引人入胜的问题：人们如何在与自己熟识并在重大事业中高度重视的人之间模糊基因界限。

None of the traditional economic models, evolutionary extrapolations, or game strategies explains why humans’ highest ideals are fundamentally unselfish - the Golden Rule, the Good Samaritan, and the admonition that
> 传统的经济模型、进化学推断或博弈策略都无法解释为什么人类最高尚的理想本质上是无私的——金科玉律、好撒玛利亚人的行为，以及那句告诫：

They don’t explain why Benjamin Franklin took pleasure in lending money with a pay-it-forward condition that ensured he would never see the cash again. “I do not pretend to give such a sum; I only lend it to you,” he wrote in the letter that accompanied the money. “When you meet with another honest man in similar distress, you must pay me by lending this sum to him; enjoining him to discharge the debt by a like operation, when he shall be able, and shall meet with another opportunity. I hope it may thus go through many hands, before it meets with a knave that will stop its progress.”
> 它们也无法解释为什么本杰明·富兰克林乐于以一种保证自己永远见不到那笔钱的“传惠条件”放贷。他在随款而寄的信中写道：“我并不装作赠与你如此一笔款项；我只是借给你。” “当你遇到另一个处于类似困境的诚实人时，你必须通过将此款借给他来偿还我；并嘱咐他在他有能力，并遇到另一个机会时，用同样的方式偿还债务。我希望它在遇到会阻止其流转的恶棍之前，能在许多人手中流转。”

There are hints in various studies that something deeper, something more meaningful, is going on in the minds of great collaborators. Some studies show that the act of cooperating itself, apart from the tangible benefits it brings, is intrinsically rewarding. The brain’s reactions “extend beyond players’ processing of outcomes, such as monetary gain, usually associated with mutual cooperation in human societies, and reflect emotional responses based on social and moral judgments.”
> 各种研究都暗示，伟大合作者的内心正在发生某种更深层、更有意义的东西。有些研究表明，合作行为本身——独立于其带来的有形好处——就是一种内在的奖励。大脑的反应“超越了参与者对结果（例如在人人合作的社会中通常与之相关的金钱收益）的处理，反映出基于社会与道德判断的情感反应。”

There are intriguing clues about why humans enjoy making others happy, such as how various hot spots in the brain coordinate to impose moral values on ordinary social events. A part of the brain that tracks the actions of others may be partly responsible for a reflex remarkably similar to the Golden Rule. “Perhaps altruism did not grow out of a

warm-glow feeling of doing good for others, but out of the simple recognition that that thing over there is a person that has intentions and goals. And therefore, I might want to treat them like I might want them to treat me,” said study author Scott Huettel, an associate professor of psychology at Duke University Medical Center.
> 那种为他人做好事而产生的温暖愉悦感，但更多是出于对“那边那个人也是有意图和目标的个体”这一简单认识。因此，我可能想要像希望别人对我那样对待他们，”该研究作者、杜克大学医学中心心理学副教授斯科特·休特尔说。

If we valued most those strategies that best fit the selfish gene, our highest ideal would be Tit for Tat, not the Good Samaritan. Yet we aim for something higher. “Self-sacrifice does not follow the rules of evolutionary biology,” wrote collaborators Ernst Fehr and Suzann-Viola Renninger. “If the immediate family does not profit and if [there is no] future advantage, then selflessness gains nothing. Worse, it is costly in terms of resources, health, or money. By this logic, there really should not be any Good Samaritans. Yet they clearly exist.”
> 如果我们最看重那些最符合自私基因的策略，我们最高的理想将是以牙还牙，而不是好撒玛利亚人。然而我们追求更高的目标。“自我牺牲并不遵循进化生物学的规则，”合作者恩斯特·费尔和苏珊-维奥拉·雷宁格写道。“如果直系亲属没有获益且[没有]未来的好处，那么无私行为一无所获。更糟的是，从资源、健康或金钱方面来看，它是有代价的。按这种逻辑，实际上不应该有任何好撒玛利亚人。但它们显然是存在的。”

Feelings of moral obligation come naturally to people. For a species allegedly controlled by selfish genes, we have an incredible capacity and reverence for unselfishness. Many people can’t resist finding religious overtones in our noblest motivations.“In an age of enlightenment and secularization, scientists such as Charles Darwin shocked contemporaries when they questioned the special status of human beings and attempted to classify them on a continuum with all other species. Humans were stripped of all that was godlike,” wrote Fehr and Renninger. “Today biology is restoring to them something of that former exalted position. Our species is apparently the only one with a genetic makeup that promotes selflessness and true altruistic behavior.”
> 道德义务的感受是人类与生俱来的。对于一个据称受自私基因控制的物种来说，我们对无私行为有着惊人的能力和崇敬。许多人忍不住在我们最崇高的动机中寻找宗教色彩。“在启蒙和世俗化的时代，像查尔斯·达尔文这样的科学家在质疑人类的特殊地位并试图将人类与所有其他物种置于同一连续体时震惊了同时代的人。人类被剥夺了所有神圣的特质，”费尔和伦宁格写道。“今天生物学正在将那种昔日高贵的地位部分恢复给人类。我们这个物种显然是唯一拥有促进无私和真正利他行为的基因构成的物种。”

While most working relationships start as calculated alliances, a remarkably large proportion of good partnerships advance to a higher plane. This level goes by different names. Sometimes it’s called “mutuality.” Academicians occasionally use the clumsy phrase “self-other merging.” In the vernacular, it’s sometimes called “kinship.” Liv Arnesen used the Norwegian word sostersjel, a “sister soul.” This bond occurs when each partner ceases looking at the arrangement strictly in terms of what it does for him and begins genuinely concerning himself with the happiness of his counterpart.
> 尽管大多数工作关系起初是经过计算的联盟，但相当大比例的良好伙伴关系会提升到更高的层次。这个层次有不同的称呼。有时称为“相互性”。学术界偶尔使用笨拙的短语“自我与他者的融合”。在通俗话语中，有时称为“亲情”。利夫·阿尔内森（Liv Arnesen）用了挪威词 sostersjel，意为“姊妹灵魂”。当每个伙伴不再仅从这段关系对自己有何益处来衡量，而是真心关心对方的幸福时，这种纽带就会产生。

Unselfishness changes everything about collaboration. When you value your partner’s rewards as much as you do your own, concerns over fairness either melt away or go in the opposite direction. “What’s in it for me?” becomes “What is my counterpart getting out of this?” “Am I being paid enough?” becomes “Am I being paid too much compared with my partner?” Waiting for the next perfect message from a counterpart becomes a concern with finding the most considerate way to communicate with him or her. “Is my partner doing enough?” becomes “Am I doing enough?” If a person values his comrade getting a reward as much as he does getting one himself, the optimal solution is always collaborative.
> 无私改变了合作的一切。当你像重视自己的回报一样重视合作伙伴的回报时，对公平的担忧要么消失，要么朝相反方向转变。“这对我有什么好处？”变成了“我的对方能从中得到什么？”“我拿的报酬够多吗？”变成了“与我的合伙人相比，我拿得是否太多？”从等待对方发出下一个完美信息，变为关心如何以最体贴的方式与他或她沟通。“我的合伙人做得够多吗？”变成了“我做得够多吗？”如果一个人像看重自己获得回报那样看重同伴获得回报，那么最佳的解决方案总是合作性的。

Science does not now and may never have all the answers as to why many partnerships, despite the compelling reasons to the contrary, reach the level of true unselfishness. But something about us deeply appreciates that they do.
> 科学现在还没有，也可能永远无法完全解释为什么许多伙伴关系尽管有相反的有力理由，仍能达到真正的无私境界。但我们内心深处对这种情况有某种深深的欣赏。

Daniel Kahneman was an early student of psychology. The gossip he heard around his family’s home in Paris intrigued him. “I grew up in a world that consisted exclusively of people and words, and most of the words were about people,” he wrote. He found people to be complex and interesting. “Some people were better than others, but the best were far from perfect and no one was simply bad. Most of [the] stories were touched by irony, and they all had two sides or more,” he explained.
> 丹尼尔·卡尼曼早年学习心理学。他在巴黎家中听到的那些闲言碎语令他着迷。“我在一个只由人和话语组成的世界里长大，而大多数话都是关于人的，”他写道。他觉得人很复杂也很有趣。“有些人比其他人更好，但最优秀的人也远非完美，没人是完全坏的。大多数故事都带着讽刺意味，而且它们都有两面或更多面，”他解释道。

He was just a boy when Nazi troops overran France. As a Jew, he was expected to wear the Star of David on his clothes and to be home by 6 p.m. Going out to play with a Christian friend one day, he stayed beyond the curfew and turned his sweater inside out to hide the emblem while he walked the several blocks back home.

“As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching,” he recalled. “He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others - the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that

After the war, Kahneman and his family immigrated to Palestine. The young man remained interested in how people think. He was more interested in what made people believe in God than in whether that belief is justified, more curious about why people find something right or wrong than in the ethics themselves. His interests deepened as he was exposed to neuropsychology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem and later, when he was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces, assigned to its psychology branch. He gravitated toward the difficulty of trying to predict human behavior.
> 战后，卡尼曼和他的家人移居到巴勒斯坦。这位年轻人仍然对人们如何思考保持兴趣。他更关心是什么让人们信仰上帝，而不是这种信仰是否有正当理由；他对人们为何认为某事对或错更感好奇，而不是对伦理本身。他在耶路撒冷希伯来大学接触到神经心理学后，这种兴趣进一步加深，后来被征召入以色列国防军并被分配到心理学部门时亦然。他逐渐倾向于研究预测人类行为这一难题。

One of the puzzles Kahneman happened across was a lieutenant in the ranks of the paratroopers. The officer was pale; he had been wounded. During a live-fire exercise, the lieutenant had ordered a non-commissioned officer to place a long metal tube loaded with explosives under the barbed wire of a position the unit was attacking. The explosion was supposed to blow open a gap where the troops could break through. The soldier placed the charge, lit the fuse, and then froze in place. Realizing that the soldier was just seconds from being killed, the lieutenant leapt from the rock he was using for cover and knocked the soldier out of harm’s way before the detonation. The lieutenant was wounded in the act of saving his comrade.
> 卡尼曼偶然遇到的一个谜题涉及一名伞兵部队中的中尉。这名军官脸色苍白；他受了伤。在一次实弹演习中，中尉下令一名士官将一根装有炸药的长金属管放到部队攻击的防御工事的铁丝网下。爆炸本应炸出一个缺口，供部队突破。那名士兵放置了炸药，点燃了导火线，然后僵在那里不动。中尉意识到士兵离被炸死只有几秒钟，便从他用作掩护的岩石上跃起，将士兵推到安全地带，随后爆炸发生。中尉在救同袍的过程中受了伤。

In 1969, Kahneman teamed up with a younger associate in Jerusalem to work on a joint paper. They were writing

about several quirks of human nature, such as the tendency for people to believe that a coin flipped heads will be more likely to balance things out by coming up tails in subsequent tosses. It turned out that Kahneman’s new colleague was the same lieutenant who risked his life to save one of his soldiers. His name was Amos Tversky.
> 关于人性的一些怪癖，比如人们倾向于认为硬币掷出正面后，接下来的掷投更可能出现反面以平衡结果。结果发现，卡尼曼的新同事正是那位冒着生命危险救下士兵的中尉。他叫阿莫斯·特沃斯基。

Kahneman discovered that his new collaborator had talents he lacked. Tversky’s style was confident and crisp, and it made Kahneman’s ideas come across stronger on the page. He was a skilled writer with “an uncanny sense of direction,” Kahneman recalled. “With him, movement was always forward. Progress might be slow, but each of the myriad of successive drafts that we produced was an improvement - this was not something I could take for granted when working on my own. . . . I was conscious of how much better it was than the more hesitant piece I would have written by myself.”
> 卡尼曼发现他的新合作者拥有他所没有的才能。特维尔斯基的风格自信而干练，使卡尼曼的想法在纸上更有力地呈现出来。卡尼曼回忆说，他是一个有“非同寻常方向感”的熟练写作者。“和他在一起，行动总是向前的。进展可能缓慢，但我们所写的每一份无数的后续稿件都是一次改进——这是我独自工作时无法理所当然得到的……我清楚地意识到，这要比我自己可能写出的更犹豫的那篇好得多。”

“The experience was magical,” Kahneman recalled. “I had enjoyed collaborative work before, but this was something different.” It wasn’t just Tversky’s intelligence - people sometimes said he was the smartest person they knew - but he was also funny, with a joke for every situation. “In his presence, I became funny as well, and the result was that we could spend hours of solid work in continuous mirth,” wrote Kahneman. When they finished their first joint paper, the men flipped a coin to decide whose name would come first on the publication.
> “那段经历如同魔法，”卡尼曼回忆道。“我以前也喜欢合作工作，但这次是不同的。”这不仅仅是特维尔斯基的聪明——人们有时说他是他们认识的最聪明的人——他还风趣，对每种情形都有笑话可说。卡尼曼写道：“在他面前，我也变得风趣，因此我们能够在持续的欢笑中连续工作数小时。”当他们完成第一篇共同论文时，两人抛硬币决定在发表时谁的名字排在前面。

In working with Tversky, Kahneman found the perfect work partner, someone with whom he would collaborate closely for the next decade. The two men found that their minds clicked in amazing ways. “Some of the greatest joys of our collaboration - and probably much of its success - came from our ability to elaborate each other’s nascent thoughts,” wrote Kahneman. “If I expressed a half-formed idea, I knew that Amos would be there to understand it, probably more clearly than I did, and that if it had merit he would see it. Like most people, I am somewhat cautious about exposing tentative thoughts to others - I must first make sure that they [the thoughts] are not idiotic. In the best years of the collaboration, this caution was completely absent. The mutual trust and the complete lack of defensiveness that we achieved were particularly remarkable because both of us - Amos even more than I - were known to be severe critics. . . . Amos and I shared the wonder of together owning a goose that could lay golden eggs - a joint mind that was better than our separate minds.”
> 在与特沃斯基合作时，卡尼曼找到了完美的工作伙伴——一个他将在接下来的十年里紧密合作的人。两人发现他们的思维以令人惊异的方式契合。“我们合作中的一些最大乐趣——也许很大程度上是成功的原因——来自于我们能够阐发彼此尚未成形的想法，”卡尼曼写道。“如果我表达了一个半成的想法，我知道阿莫斯会在那里去理解它，可能比我自己更清楚，并且如果它有价值，他会看出来。像大多数人一样，我对于向他人暴露试探性的想法有些谨慎——我必须先确保那些想法不是愚蠢的。在合作最好的那些年，这种谨慎完全不存在。我们所达到的相互信任和完全缺乏防御性尤其引人注目，因为我们两人——阿莫斯比我更甚——都以苛刻的批评者著称……阿莫斯和我共同拥有一只会下金蛋的鹅这一奇迹让我们感到惊叹——一种共同的头脑比我们各自的头脑更出色。”

Because Kahneman was a morning person and Tversky was a night owl, they fell into a pattern of meeting for lunch and spending long afternoons working together. They talked a lot, not just about the research, but about everything. Both learned how the other thought, and each could sometimes complete his counterpart’s sentences. There was no explicit division of labor; they wrote their questionnaires and papers together.
> 因为卡尼曼是个早起的人而特沃斯基是夜猫子，他们逐渐形成了午餐时见面并一起工作整个下午的模式。他们聊得很多，不仅仅是研究，还包括其他所有事情。双方都逐渐了解对方的思维方式，有时甚至能接上对方的话。他们没有明确分工；问卷和论文都是一起写的。

When they disagreed, they discussed the issue until it was resolved. They agreed that if they were stuck on whether a certain reference should be included in a paper, Tversky would make the final call. If they disagreed how to resolve a grammatical issue, Kahneman would decide. After the original coin toss put Tversky’s name first, they alternated the order of names on subsequent papers. In time, their colleagues began calling them the “dynamic duo.”
> 当他们意见不合时，会讨论问题直到达成解决。他们约定如果在是否将某个引用纳入论文上陷入僵局，就由特沃斯基做最终决定；如果对如何解决语法问题存在分歧，就由卡尼曼来裁定。在最初通过抛硬币决定将特沃斯基的名字排在前面之后，他们在随后的论文中交替署名。随着时间推移，同行们开始称他们为“动态二人组”。

Their research and writing became some of the most important work in the field now known as behavioral economics. Traditional economics examines social problems from the perspective of a hypothetical, highly rational person - a person who, it turns out, doesn’t exist. It uses a tremendous amount of math, much of it calculations the average person cannot follow, to determine how various incentives should influence people’s actions. Behavioral economics focuses on how real-life human reactions differ from the prediction of what a purely rational being would do. Like the selfish gene theory, traditional economics predicts much less cooperation between people than is found when behavioral economists actually put people together and watch them cooperate. One is based on theory, the other on reality.
> 他们的研究和著述成为了现在称为行为经济学领域中最重要的工作之一。传统经济学从一个假设的、高度理性的人的角度来考察社会问题——而这种人实际上并不存在。它使用大量的数学，其中许多计算是普通人无法理解的，以确定各种激励应该如何影响人们的行为。行为经济学则关注现实中人类的反应如何与纯理性存在所作出的预测不同。像自私基因理论一样，传统经济学预测的人与人之间的合作远少于行为经济学家将人们聚集在一起观察他们合作时所发现的。一个基于理论，另一个基于现实。

People don’t think like computers, Tversky and Kahneman argued. They reach decisions through rules of thumb subject to mortal biases that lead to severe and systematic errors. People “systematically violate the axioms of expected utility theory,” they wrote in one paper. The theory of decision making, they wrote in a
> 特韦尔斯基和卡尼曼认为，人们并不像计算机那样思考。人们通过经验法则做出决定，这些法则受致命偏见的影响，会导致严重而系统性的错误。他们在一篇论文中写道，人们“系统性地违反期望效用理论的公设”。他们在一篇关于决策制定的论文中写道，

subsequent paper, “was conceived as a normative model of an idealized decision maker, not as a description of the behavior of real people.”
> 后来的论文“被构想为一种规范模型，用来描绘一个理想化决策者，而不是对真实人类行为的描述。”

Through numerous insights into the way real people make real decisions, Kahneman and Tversky became luminaries in behavioral economics. They did so despite the fact, or maybe because of the fact, that they were not economists but psychologists. Tversky once described his work as taking a scientific view of patterns that were well-known to advertisers and used-car salesmen. A large proportion of the academic studies conducted on the partner’s dilemma, on the brains of people interacting with someone else, on the issue of fairness between collaborators, and on how reputations are formed make at least one reference to Tversky and Kahneman.
> 通过对真实人们如何做出真实决策的诸多见解，卡尼曼和特沃斯基成为了行为经济学的杰出人物。他们之所以能取得这一地位，尽管——或许正因为——他们并非经济学家而是心理学家。特沃斯基曾将他的工作描述为对那些广告商和二手车推销员早已熟知的模式进行科学化观察。关于合伙人困境、人与他人互动时大脑活动、合作者之间公平问题以及声誉如何形成的大量学术研究，至少有一部分引用了特沃斯基和卡尼曼。

In 1978, Kahneman and his wife moved to British Columbia, Canada, while Tversky and his wife settled in Stanford, California. “Amos and I were then at the peak of our joint game, and completely committed to our collaboration. For a few years, we managed to maintain it, by spending every second weekend together and by placing multiple phone calls each day, some lasting several hours,” Kahneman recalled. "But eventually the goose that had laid the golden eggs languished, and our collaboration tapered off. Although this outcome now appears inevitable, it came as a painful surprise to us. We had completely failed to appreciate how critically our successful interaction had depended on our being together at the birth of every significant idea, on our rejection of any formal division of
> 1978 年，卡尼曼和他的妻子搬到了加拿大不列颠哥伦比亚省，而特维尔斯基和他的妻子则定居在加州斯坦福。“那时阿莫斯和我正处在我们合作的巅峰，完全投入于我们的协作。几年间，我们设法维持这种状态，每个周末都在一起度过，每天打好几次电话，有时通话会持续好几个小时，”卡尼曼回忆道。“但最终那只下金蛋的鹅衰弱了，我们的合作逐渐减弱。尽管这一结果现在看起来不可避免，但当时对我们来说却是痛苦的惊讶。我们完全没有意识到，我们成功的互动在多大程度上依赖于在每一个重要想法诞生之时的共同在场，依赖于我们拒绝任何正式的劳动分工，以及当我们只能定期见面时才显得奢侈的无限耐心。我们多年来努力尝试恢复失去的魔力，但都徒劳无功。”

Even as Kahneman moved to other universities Berkeley and then Princeton - the two men stayed in touch and collaborated as best they could from a distance. Well-thought-of before they began collaborating, the men were even more highly respected because of their work together, and each went on to other fruitful partnerships and additional regard in the scientific community.
> 即便卡尼曼后来转到其他大学——先是伯克利，随后是普林斯顿——两人仍保持联系，并尽力在远距离下进行合作。二人合作前已颇受好评，合作后因共同的工作声望更高，各自又与他人建立了富有成果的伙伴关系，在科学界获得了更大的认可。

Then circumstances conspired to end Kahneman and Tversky’s collaboration before either man was done. In early 1996, Tversky was diagnosed with skin cancer that had metastasized. He had only a few months to live. With so little time, he and his longtime collaborator determined to take on one last project, to edit a book on decision making that would describe work in the field since the two men began their partnership.
> 然后种种情况导致卡尼曼与特沃斯基的合作在两人都未了却心愿前就结束了。1996 年初，特沃斯基被诊断出皮肤癌并已转移，所剩时间寥寥。他与长期合作者决定在有限的时间内完成最后一个项目：编辑一本关于决策制定的书，综述自两人开始合作以来该领域的工作。

“We planned an ambitious preface as a joint project, but I think we both knew from the beginning that we would not be granted enough time to complete it,” wrote Kahneman. In June of 1996, Tversky died. “The preface I wrote alone,” recalled the surviving partner, “was probably my most painful writing experience.”
> “我们计划以合写序言作为一项雄心勃勃的联合工程，但我想我们从一开始就知道不会有足够的时间完成它，”卡尼曼写道。1996 年 6 月，特沃斯基去世了。“那篇由我独自写成的序言，”这位幸存的搭档回忆道，“大概是我写作经历中最痛苦的一次。”

In 2002, Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics. It is widely speculated that Amos Tversky would have shared the award had he lived long enough. Unable to claim the honor with his collaborator,
> 2002 年，丹尼尔·卡尼曼获得了诺贝尔经济学奖。人们普遍推测，如果阿莫斯·特沃斯基活得足够久，他本应与之共享这一奖项。因为无法和合作者一同领取这一荣誉，

Kahneman brought along his friend’s memory in the form of a large photo of Tversky he projected on the screen at the beginning of the prize lecture. “The work on which the award was given was done jointly with Amos Tversky during a long period of unusually close collaboration,” Kahneman told the audience. “He should have been here.”
> 卡尼曼在颁奖演讲开始时把朋友的记忆带来了——他在屏幕上投出了一张特沃斯基的大幅照片。“授予该奖项的工作是在与阿莫斯·特沃斯基长期异常密切的合作期间共同完成的，”卡尼曼在台上告诉听众。“他本该在这里。”

In his Nobel Prize autobiography, Kahneman went into detail about the rewards of collaborating with Tversky, his great admiration for him, and his tremendous feeling of personal loss at his absence. “There is less intelligence in the world,” he wrote. “There is less wit. There are many questions that will never be answered with the same inimitable combination of depth and clarity. There are standards that will not be defended with the same mix of principle and good sense. Life has become poorer. There is a large Amosshaped gap in the mosaic, and it will not be filled.”
> 在他的诺贝尔自传中，卡尼曼详述了与特沃斯基合作的回报、他对特沃斯基的深厚钦佩以及在其缺席时强烈的个人失落感。“这个世界少了些智慧，”他写道。“少了些机智。许多问题将永远无法以那种无可比拟的深度与清晰度得到解答。有些准则将不会再以同样兼具原则与常识的方式得到捍卫。生活因此变得贫瘠。在这幅马赛克中出现了一个巨大、呈阿莫斯形状的空缺，而它不会被填补。”

“The 12 or 13 years in which most of our work was joint were years of interpersonal and intellectual bliss,” wrote the Nobel laureate. “Everything was interesting, almost everything was funny, and there was the recurrent joy of seeing an idea take shape.”
> “在我们大部分合作的那 12 或 13 年里，是人际关系和智力上的极乐时光，”这位诺贝尔奖得主写道。“一切都很有趣，几乎所有事情都令人发笑，而且不断出现的喜悦是看到一个想法成形。”

Kahneman ended his life story with a compliment to his fellow researcher: “I have almost never had that experience with anyone else. If you have not had it, you don’t know how marvelous collaboration can be.”
> 卡尼曼在他的生平故事结尾处赞扬了他的合作者：“我几乎从未与其他人有过那样的体验。如果你没有过这种经历，你就不知道合作可以有多美妙。”

Add another person to the equation, and the potential for problems explodes. The two of you must always stay on the common ground of a shared mission. Both of you are apt to overestimate your own contributions, to see the other’s weaknesses clearer than his strengths, to find the other’s way of doing things odd, to make wrong assumptions and communicate too little, and perhaps to find trust itself elusive. The most dangerous trap of collaboration is the convenient availability of someone else to blame for its failure.

Collaborating well demands a degree of accommodation and humility rarely needed otherwise. It can require exceptional diplomatic abilities, awareness, countering your natural biases, and the flexibility to incorporate another strong ego into the demands of your own. Occasionally, it requires great self-control and forgiveness. In all cases, it demands an intense desire to achieve the mutual goal that overcomes what Tenzing Norgay called the “small bickerings and resentments,” the “molehills” that interfere with scaling the mountain.
> 良好合作要求一种在其他情况下很少需要的迁就与谦逊。它可能需要卓越的外交能力、敏锐的觉察力、克服自身的天然偏见，以及将另一个强势自我纳入自身要求的灵活性。有时，它还需要巨大的自制力与宽恕心。在所有情况下，它都要求一种强烈的共同目标愿望，能够克服丹增·诺尔盖所说的那些“微小的争吵与怨恨”，那些妨碍登山的“小土堆”。

If you want to have great partnerships, be a great partner. Get beyond yourself. Give up the notion that you are well-rounded, and stop expecting your colleagues to be universally proficient. Incorporate someone else’s motivations into your view of the accomplishment. Loosen up. Put aside your competitive nature, your prepackaged view of how the thing should be done, and your desire not to be inconvenienced with the imperfections of a fellow human being. Focus more on what you do for the partnership than what you get from it. Demonstrate trust in more people, and see if they don’t surprise you with their trustworthiness. Be slower to anger and quicker to forgive. And along the way, communicate continuously.

Most of the scholarly work on partnerships assumes the two players have equal power．The partner＇s dilemma usually pairs up two players who receive identical rewards for cooperating or unilaterally defecting，the same punishments for being suckered or for mutual betrayal． These lab settings match real－life situations when a manager gives two employees a shared task，an instructor assigns two students a joint paper，or two volunteers agree to team up for a good cause．

Yet many of the most important collaborative opportunities arise when one person in a pair has power over the other．It＇s not unusual for one of the partners to have the ear of the CEO，to be a member of the family that owns the company，to control the purse strings，or some other coercive capacity not matched by the other person． In many potential partnerships，one person is the manager

> 。这些可能是一些最令人沮丧的关系，尤其是对权力较小的一方而言。

An employee’s collaborative relationship with his supervisor is more than twice as likely to show up in the negative column than in the positive one, according to Gallup’s research. When asked to name someone with whom they have had a poor partnership, 32 percent of people name their manager. When asked to name someone with whom they’ve had a good partnership, only 15 percent name their manager.
> 根据盖洛普的研究，员工与其上司的协作关系在负面评价中出现的可能性是正面评价的两倍多。当被问到曾与谁有过糟糕的合作关系时，32% 的人称他们的经理；而当被问到曾与谁有过良好的合作关系时，只有 15% 的人称他们的经理。

The most fundamental misunderstanding about partnerships between managers and the managed is that they should not exist at all. Sixteen percent of managers flat-out admit they are more like a boss than a partner to those they supervise. According to this line of thinking, partnerships exist only between equals. “I’m not the manager because I’m always right, but I’m always right because I’m the manager,” said major league baseball manager Gene Mauch, the most frequently winning manager to have never won a pennant and architect of some of the game’s longest losing streaks.
> 关于经理与被管理者之间伙伴关系的最根本误解是认为这种关系根本不应该存在。16% 的经理直言不讳地承认，他们对下属更像是老板而不是合伙人。按照这种思路，伙伴关系只存在于平等者之间。“我不是因为我总是正确才当经理，而是因为我是经理才总是正确，”大联盟棒球经理吉恩·莫奇（Gene Mauch）曾说过。他是从未赢得过旗帜赛却胜率最高的经理，也是造成一些最长连败纪录的策划者。

Eighty-four percent of managers claim they are more a partner than a boss, but many of those who report to them would beg to differ. Among employees, only 53 percent say their manager is more like a partner than a boss.

Differences in rank can be deceiving, creating the impression that the “subordinate” has few alternatives should her “superior” flex his muscles and enforce compliance. The evidence indicates just the opposite. Employees may lack official authority, but their informal power is substantial. Executives, managers, and other higher ranking partners do better when they build a partnership than when they exercise command.
> 等级差异可能会产生误导，让人以为“下属”在其“上司”展示权威并强制执行时几乎没有选择。证据显示恰恰相反。员工可能缺乏正式权力，但他们的非正式影响力很大。高管、经理以及其他较高阶层的伙伴若是建立伙伴关系，往往比行使命令更为有利。

When research partners Ernst Fehr and Simon Gächter wanted to understand the dilemmas faced by employers and employees, they created a small-scale job market and watched it in action. Their volunteers were randomly assigned to be either someone buying work (employers) or selling it (employees). The buyers announced what level of work quality they wanted and what they were willing to pay for it. Then the sellers got the chance to decide individually whether to take a job, which to choose, and what level of work they would give. Only one employee at a time could work for each employer. To give more power to the employers, six buyers were matched with eight sellers, guaranteeing the prospect of “unemployment.”
> 当研究合作者恩斯特·费尔（Ernst Fehr）和西蒙·盖赫特（Simon Gächter）想要理解雇主和雇员面临的困境时，他们创建了一个小型的劳动力市场并观察其运作。志愿者被随机分配为购买劳动的一方（雇主）或出售劳动的一方（雇员）。买方会宣布他们想要的工作质量水平以及愿意为此支付的报酬。然后卖方有机会单独决定是否接受某份工作、选择哪份工作以及他们将提供何种质量的工作。每位雇主一次只能雇佣一名雇员。为增强雇主的权力，六名买家与八名卖家配对，从而保证出现“失业”的可能性。

Fehr and Gächter devised two sets of rules for their laboratory labor market. In the first, the employee could “shirk,” giving lower quality work than the employer bid for,

without any penalty to the worker. The researchers called this the “trust” condition. In the second condition, the manager had a one-in-three chance of verifying whether his worker shirked, and if he had, the boss could impose a fine. This was called the “incentive” condition.
> 而对工人没有任何惩罚。研究者将此称为“信任”情景。在第二种情景中，经理有三分之一的机会核查雇员是否偷懒，如果确认偷懒，老板可以处以罚款。这被称为“激励”情景。

Long-standing economic theories predict that the employees should work harder under threat of having their pay docked. The incentive scenario is supposed to provide a way for the employer to offer higher wages for better work because he can enforce those expectations. When the employer cannot punish slacking, so the logic goes, the employee has every selfish reason to give low-quality work, and knowing this, the employer has every reason to make only a minimum wage offer.
> 长期以来的经济理论预测，在工资可能被扣减的威胁下，员工会更努力工作。激励情景被认为为雇主提供了一种方式，可以因能强制这些期望而为更好的工作提供更高工资。按照这种逻辑，当雇主无法惩罚偷懒时，员工就有充分的自私理由提供低质量工作，而雇主也有充分理由只开出最低工资。

This conventional wisdom is wrong. The employees who were trusted and not coerced agreed to work harder than those whose compliance was forced. “Voluntary cooperation may indeed be undermined by incentive contracts,” wrote Fehr and Gächter. When employers have the option, they usually choose more fines and less pay. This backfires, causing low work levels that ensure the employer pays the price for his penny pinching. “Even if the buyers combine the threat of fining with the payment of relatively high prices, the sellers’ voluntary cooperation remains low,” they concluded. It is a sense of moral obligation, not the point of an economic spear, that motivates the best levels of performance.
> 这种传统观点是错误的。被信任而非被强迫的员工同意比那些被迫服从的人更努力工作。费尔和盖希特写道：“激励合同确实可能破坏自愿合作。”当雇主有选择时，他们通常会选择更多的罚款和更少的报酬。这会适得其反，导致低工作水平，从而确保雇主为其小气付出代价。他们得出结论：“即便买方将罚款的威胁与相对较高的价格支付相结合，卖方的自愿合作仍然很低。”激发最佳绩效的是一种道德义务感，而不是经济手段的利器。

A BOSS OR A PARTNER?
> 一个上司还是一个合伙人？

In manager-employee relationships as in peer-to-peer collaborations, reciprocity is more powerful than rationality. The difference in rank is not enough to change the friend-orfoe wiring and the extreme positive and negative reactions on both sides of the switch. With their managers as much as with their peers, people mirror what they perceive coming from the other person. To what’s given begrudgingly, they return begrudgingly. To what’s given generously, they reciprocate generously.
> 在管理者与员工的关系中，如同在同级同事之间的合作里，互惠比理性更有力量。职位高低的差异不足以改变“朋友或敌人”的连线，也无法改变开关两端的极端正面和负面反应。无论是对待经理还是对待同事，人们都会反映出他们从对方那里感知到的态度。对吝惜给出的东西，他们也会吝惜回报；对慷慨给予的，他们则会慷慨回报。

Nowhere has this been demonstrated more exhaustively than in Gallup’s international employee engagement database. At this printing, the repository holds the responses from 15 million surveys of managers and employees, gathered in 63 languages and in 163 countries. These respondents rated their level of agreement with 12 crucial statements about their work environment, many of which focus on the tenor of their relationship with their manager. “My supervisor, or someone at work, seems to care about me as a person,” states one of the items. Other items focus on aspects such as the employee feeling connected to the mission of the company, having the chance to use her strengths every day, getting recognition for good work, feeling as though her opinions count, and having someone talk to her about her progress.
> 在这方面，盖洛普的国际员工敬业度数据库提供了最详尽的证明。到本次印刷时，该数据库收录了来自 163 个国家、以 63 种语言收集的 1500 万份经理和员工调查答卷。受访者对关于其工作环境的 12 条关键陈述表达了同意程度，其中许多陈述关注他们与上司关系的性质。其中一项写道：“我的主管，或工作中的某个人，似乎关心我这个人。”其他条目则侧重于诸如员工是否感到与公司使命相连、是否每天都有机会发挥其优势、是否因出色工作获得认可、是否觉得自己的意见很重要，以及是否有人与其谈论其工作进展等方面。

Final Report of the National Commission on the Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States
> 《美国遭受恐怖袭击国家委员会最终报告》

Guy Gannett Communications was a family-owned company in Maine determined to create a partnership that would revolutionize the media world. In the mid-1990s, the firm embarked on a strategy of increasing collaboration between its largest newspaper, the Portland Press Herald, and its Portland TV station, WGME. They were entering a new “dimension,” the leaders proclaimed.
> 盖伊·甘奈特传播公司是一家位于缅因州的家族企业，决心打造一种将彻底改变媒体世界的合作伙伴关系。上世纪九十年代中期，该公司着手推动其最大报纸《波特兰新闻先驱报》与旗下波特兰电视台 WGME 之间的协作。他们的领导人宣称，他们正在进入一个新的“维度”。

Under U.S. antitrust laws, a company cannot maintain a duopoly by owning a daily newspaper and a TV station in the same market. But the rule does not apply to businesses that owned both properties before the 1972 regulation went into effect.
> 在美国反垄断法下，一家公司不能通过在同一市场同时拥有一家日报和一家电视台来维持双寡头地位。但该规则不适用于在 1972 年法规生效前就同时拥有这两类媒体的企业。

POWER OF 2

Wanting to make the most of their legal exemption, Guy Gannett officials began encouraging “synergy” between the two previously autonomous units. Committees of executives from both properties were formed. The TV station and the newspaper commissioned shared market research. The respective advertising departments were pushed closer together, first gently, then explicitly. So were the print and broadcast news operations.
> 为了充分利用他们的法律豁免，盖内特公司（Guy Gannett）的管理层开始推动这两个此前各自独立部门之间的“协同”。由两处财产的高管组成的委员会成立了。电视台和报纸委托进行了共同的市场调研。各自的广告部被逐步拉得更近，起初是温和的，随后变得明确。印刷和广播新闻部门也是如此。

“We could not just rely on their good nature and good intentions,” said James B. Shaffer, Guy Gannett’s CEO at the time. “Only reorganizing the company broke loose collaborative sales.” Various TV and newspaper leaders who disagreed with the strategy or doubted its longevity left or were dismissed. “New managers came in, and I went out,” wrote former Press Herald Editor-in-Chief Lou Ureneck. “One day you’re a hero; the next day you’re meeting with an employment counselor at your former employer’s expense and trying to rearrange your identity.”
> “我们不能仅仅依靠他们的善意和良好意图，”当时盖伊·甘奈特（Guy Gannett）的首席执行官詹姆斯·B·谢弗（James B. Shaffer）说。“只有通过重组公司，协作式销售才得以松动。”那些不同意这一策略或怀疑其持久性的各种电视台和报纸负责人要么离开要么被解雇。“新经理进来，我被淘汰，”前《新闻先驱报》（Press Herald）总编辑卢·乌雷内克（Lou Ureneck）写道。“有一天你还是英雄；第二天你就在前雇主出资下会见就业顾问，试图重塑你的身份。”

The strategy began to take hold. Some of the TV and newspaper salespeople began making joint calls to advertisers. The lead headlines from the next day’s Press Herald were announced on WGME’s 11 p.m. newscast, and the TV station’s meteorologists and forecasts were featured on the newspaper’s weather page. Such collaboration “better serves readers and viewers journalistically,” said Bruce J. Gensmer, a company executive appointed to bring both media together. “The hearts and minds of advertisers won’t be far behind.”
> 这一策略开始见效。一些电视台和报纸的销售人员开始共同拜访广告主。《新闻先驱报》次日的头条在 WGME 的晚上 11 点新闻中播出，电视台的气象播报员和预报也登上了报纸的天气版面。被任命负责将两种媒体结合起来的一位公司高管布鲁斯·J·根斯默（Bruce J. Gensmer）说，这种合作“在新闻上更好地服务于读者和观众”。“广告主的心意和支持也不会遥远。”

But cynicism about the new partnership ran deep through the Old Port offices of the Press Herald and those of the CBS affiliate four miles on the other side of Back Cove. Any TV-side employee who jumped in with both feet risked being played for a fool by her newspaper-side counterpart, and vice versa. Some employees doubted the assertions of company Chairwoman Madeleine Corson, Guy Gannett’s granddaughter, that the company was committed for the long haul to owning and integrating both media. Newspaper-TV synergy was the flavor of the month, they said.
> 但对于这桩新型合作关系，旧港区新闻先驱报社办公室以及四英里外巴克湾另一侧的 CBS 附属台的工作人员都深感愤世嫉俗。任何电视台一方全力投入的人都有可能被报纸一方的同事当成傻瓜玩弄，反之亦然。一些员工怀疑公司董事长、盖奈特家族的孙女玛德琳·科尔森所言——公司会长期持有并整合两种媒体——的真实性。他们说，报纸与电视的协同只是当下流行的说辞。

Then, on April Fools’ Day of 1998, the skeptics were proven right. Corson and her uncle and fellow company trustee, John H. Gannett, announced they were putting the business on the auction block. Game over. The sale would close the antitrust loophole, forcing the Press Herald and WGME to go to separate buyers and become competitors again. Partnerships that were required one day were forbidden the next.
> 然后，在 1998 年愚人节那天，怀疑论者被证明是对的。科尔森和她的叔叔、同为公司受托人的约翰·H·盖奈特宣布将把公司资产拿到拍卖台上出售。游戏结束。出售将堵死反托拉斯的漏洞，迫使新闻先驱报和 WGME 分属不同买家，再次成为竞争对手。曾经被允许的合作关系一夜之间变成了被禁止。

After the newspaper was sold to one buyer and the TV station to another, the Gannett family was left more than half a billion dollars richer. Their former employees were left confused. Just as the government orator in George Orwell’s 1984 announced that the old ally was the new enemy and the old enemy the new ally, the Press Herald announced a “news-sharing partnership” with a different TV station, Portland ABC affiliate WMTW, whose executive vice president made collaborative noises of his
> 在报纸被卖给一位买家、电视台被卖给另一位买家之后，甘尼特家族的财富增加了超过五亿美元。他们的前雇员们则感到困惑。正如乔治·奥威尔《一九八四》中的政府演说者宣布旧盟友成了新敌人、旧敌人成了新盟友那样，《新闻先驱报》宣布与另一家电视台——波特兰的 ABC 附属台 WMTW——建立“新闻共享合作关系”，该台执行副总裁也发出了自己的合作噪声：

> 那些接受甘尼特聘用并搬家到缅因州以参与最初合作的人们，以及那些在职员工们为使电视—报纸合作关系运作而倾注最大努力的人们，都被愚弄了。

The cruel paradox was that the same leaders of the company who, early in the process, could not understand why some people resisted the initiative later demonstrated why those cynics were dead on.

The “new dimension” Guy Gannett Communication’s leaders said they were entering is, in fact, a very old one. Every organization faces issues of collaboration, getting various departments to cooperate with each other, trying to make the most of a marketing alliance with another company, or working through a merger or acquisition.
> 盖伊·加内特传播公司高层所说他们正在进入的“新领域”，实际上是一个非常古老的领域。每个组织都面临协作问题，让各个部门相互配合，努力充分利用与另一家公司建立的营销联盟，或在兼并或收购中处理相关事务。

The commission created to investigate security breaches preceding the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States found, among other issues, a serious lack of collaboration among the various U.S. intelligence agencies. Those agencies now answer to the new Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) under the charge that they find better ways of working together. “In the past, the Intelligence Community was siloed into discrete disciplines and functions. These silos often led to competition and duplication,” states an unclassified ODNI strategy outline. “We must transcend the current agency-based linear model . . . and develop a more mission-based model that is fluid, synchronizes collection, collaborates on analytic issues in real time, and broadens our partnership strategy.”

integration. There are dozens of terms for the strategy of bringing together - sometimes forcing together two entities on the assumption that when united they can accomplish what neither enterprise could do alone. But they all refer to the same problem: how to create a collaborative organization.
> 整合。有很多术语用来描述将两个实体聚合——有时甚至以强制方式假定合并后能完成单个企业无法完成的任务——但它们都指向同一个问题：如何创建一个协作型组织。

A study of nearly 5,000 mergers and acquisitions found that the target companies not only suffer the “natural and acceptable” loss of many executives shortly after the combination, but “leadership continuity is permanently altered once the firm is acquired. Target companies can expect to lose 21 percent or more of their executives each year - more than double that experienced in non-merged firms - for at least 10 years after the acquisition!”
> 对近 5000 宗并购的研究发现，目标公司不仅在合并后不久会出现“自然且可接受”的大量高管流失，而且“一旦公司被收购，领导层的连续性就会永久改变。目标公司可以预计在每年失去 21%或更多的高管——这一比例在被收购后的至少 10 年里是未并购公司所经历流失率的两倍多！”

More often than not, the two firms fail to integrate, fail to realize the promised synergy, lose momentum on key projects the companies were implementing before the merger, lose executives with years of experience and knowledge about the firms, and ignore “negative effects of the merger on target employees that eventually erode productivity.”
> 更多时候，这两家公司未能实现整合，未能兑现所承诺的协同效应，已在合并前实施的关键项目失去推进力，拥有多年经验和公司知识的高管流失，并忽视“并购对目标公司员工的负面影响，这些影响最终侵蚀生产力”。

Whether pushing together companies or departments, leaders usually fail to realize the complexities into which they are getting themselves. The combination of Group A and Group B looks clean only on paper. In practice, it is the messy business of hundreds or thousands of employees from Group A each working with 1, 2, or 10 people from Group B, and vice versa. Strangers come in. Trusted associates leave or are laid off. Thousands have new working relationships imposed on them at a time of intense uncertainty and vulnerability.
> 无论是推动公司合并还是部门协作，领导者通常未能意识到他们将要卷入的复杂局面。在纸面上，A 组与 B 组的结合看起来很干净利落。但在实际操作中，成百上千来自 A 组的员工分别与 1 个、2 个或 10 个来自 B 组的人一起工作，反之亦然，情况往往混乱不堪。陌生人加入进来，值得信赖的同事离开或被裁员。成千上万的人在充满不确定性和脆弱性的时期被强制建立新的工作关系。

There is a reason parts of a company are called divisions. Most often, they are divided from the rest of the organization, pursuing their own ends, suspicious of those outside their fold. “To simply assume . . . that the transformation will succeed or the myriad issues and concerns associated with it will work themselves out in the long run is naïve,” wrote one authority on the subject. “A merger or acquisition is ultimately a human process.”
> 公司某些部分之所以被称为“部门”是有原因的。它们大多与组织的其他部分分割开来，追求自己的目标，对圈外的人持怀疑态度。正如一位该领域的权威所写：“简单地假设……转型将会成功，或者与之相关的无数问题和顾虑最终会自行解决，是幼稚的。合并或收购归根结底是一个人类的过程。”

As the Union Army made plans in late 1862 to take Vicksburg, Mississippi, President Abraham Lincoln gave General John McClernand secret orders to organize troops for an attempt at the city. But General Ulysses S. Grant was already pursuing the same goal, and no one made sure they were united in the endeavor.
> 1862 年末，当联邦军制定占领密西西比州维克斯堡的计划时，总统亚伯拉罕·林肯秘密下令约翰·麦克伦南将军组织部队进攻该城。但尤利西斯·S·格兰特将军已经在追求同一目标，却无人确保他们在这一行动上保持一致。

“Vicksburg was 250 miles away, and as (Grant) saw it the town belonged to the man who got there first,” wrote historian Shelby Foote. At one point when Grant would normally have waited for reinforcements, he instead proceeded south. “I feared that delay might bring McClernand,” the general wrote later. The Union subsequently lost the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou, the first contest in what became a six-month campaign. Grant was “fighting two wars simultaneously: one against the Confederacy . . . and the other against a man who, like himself, wore blue,” wrote Foote.
> “维克斯堡相距 250 英里，格兰特认为谁先到达，城镇就属于谁，”历史学家谢尔比·福特写道。在格兰特本应等待增援的时刻，他反而向南前进。“我担心拖延可能会让麦克伦南赶上来，”将军后来写道。联军随后在奇卡绍湾口战役中失利，这是随后长达六个月战役的首场较量。福特写道，格兰特“同时在打两场仗：一场是对抗邦联……另一场是对抗一个和他一样穿蓝衣服的人”。

Leaders working to unify their organizations often have their public relations staff create slogans aspiring to make their company “one.” “One Company. One Team. One Passion,” touts Coca-Cola. “One Company. One Team. One Goal,” proclaims LexisNexis. “One Team, One Mission,” states a U.S. Department of Homeland Security strategy document.

Without credible high-level commitments to following through, prominent partnership examples, the right incentives, and a truly collaborative culture, these slogans are just that - mere slogans. "It was obvious from the start that (our) sister company had a completely different culture than we did,"reported one technology manager. “As software distributors, we shared many of the same product lines and dealt with many of the same technologies. We both did the same thing - sold tech products to computer retailers across the country and around the world. The merger failed miserably. We simply could not get along. There were too many egos and too many superstars. Eventually our West Coast outfit was closed in favor of the East Coast company.”
> 如果没有可信的高层承诺去兑现、没有突出的合作示例、没有恰当的激励机制以及没有真正的协作文化，这些口号就只是口号而已。“从一开始就很明显，（我们）姊妹公司的文化与我们完全不同，”一位技术经理报告道。“作为软件分销商，我们有许多相同的产品线，处理许多相同的技术。我们做的事情都一样——向全国乃至全球的电脑零售商销售技术产品。合并惨败。我们根本无法相处。自负的人太多，明星人物太多。最终我们关闭了西海岸的机构，以东海岸公司为主。”

When Daimler-Benz AG merged with Chrysler in 1998, Daimler-Benz Chairman Jürgen Schrempp and Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton appeared at an hourlong announcement event in neutral London heralding a “perfect fit of two leaders in their respective markets.” They said it was a “merger of equals” and that the two of them would be co-chairmen. But the combination became more an acquisition of Chrysler than a merger, and despite some early victories, it didn’t live up to its collaborative or financial billing.

“So far, DaimlerChrysler is a trans-Atlantic partnership mostly in name,” observed the International Herald Tribune one year later. “DaimlerChrysler is pretty much run by Daimler executives. From the ubiquitous chief executive officer Jürgen Schrempp on down, the big decisions are made in Stuttgart. Chrysler managers complain they are lame ducks.” Eaton left less than two years after the “merger of equals” press conference.

No leader who is a poor partner should expect to preside over a successful alliance between organizations. No leader who struggles to collaborate should expect his or her subordinate leaders or departments to do so. “Do what I say, not what I do” doesn’t work any better here than it does in any other aspect of leadership.
> 任何一个不擅长做合作者的领导者都不应指望能主持成功的组织联盟。任何在协作上有困难的领导者也不应指望其下属领导或部门能够做到协作。“做我说的，不要做我做的”在这里并不比在领导力的任何其他方面更奏效。

One of the richest ironies in many organizations is that the executive urging partnerships on the managers and employees is someone who recently ousted his or her counterpart to take control of the combined enterprise. This spawns cascading Darwinian battles through operations, finance, sales, marketing, and every department where an executive sees more reason to compete than to cooperate.
> 在许多组织中，一个最富讽刺意味的现象是：那个敦促经理和员工开展合作关系的高管，往往是最近把其对手赶下台以掌控合并企业的人。这在运营、财务、销售、市场以及所有高管认为更应竞争而非合作的部门，引发了一连串达尔文式的争斗。

Without powerful examples among the leaders, collaborations that began as a “merger of equals” degenerate into a series of cage matches that distract both camps from the business at hand. An enterprise that sets out to collaborate without building partnerships throughout will be worse off than one that never pretended to enter that dimension. Those partnerships begin at the top.
> 如果领导层没有为合作树立强有力的榜样，那些以“平等合并”开始的协作就会沦为一场场关在笼中的对决，使双方都无法专注于眼前的业务。一个在没有在全公司建立伙伴关系的情况下试图合作的企业，其结局往往比从未假装进入那个领域的企业更糟。这样的伙伴关系必须从高层开始。

Employee engagement is highly related to the positive relationships between supervisors and employees. It is wellestablished that a positive employee-supervisor collaborative relationship, rather than a hierarchical boss-underling relationship, is more conducive to employee engagement and subsequently to a more productive work environment. But what are the key elements of such well-functioning relationships? That was the research question that inspired this work.

The investigators asked their colleagues and clients about supervisor-employee relationships and looked for patterns in their responses. They also conducted an extensive review of relevant literature. This latter effort yielded little with the exception of one key dissertation by Mary Leanna Ayers titled Transformational Partnerships: A Relational Model of Dyadic Business Partnerships. In her paper, Ayers proposes a model of the business partnership that “creates an environment in which each person in the relationship grows personally and professionally.”
> 早期工作。1990 年代后期，进行了一些非正式的、以定性为主的调查。研究者向同事和客户询问主管与员工之间的关系，并从他们的回答中寻找模式。他们还对相关文献进行了广泛的回顾。除了一篇由 Mary Leanna Ayers 撰写的关键学位论文《变革型伙伴关系：二元商业伙伴关系的关系模型》（Transformational Partnerships: A Relational Model of Dyadic Business Partnerships）之外，这后一项工作所得甚少。在她的论文中，Ayers 提出了一种商业伙伴关系模型，该模型“创造了一种环境，使关系中的每个人在个人和职业上都能成长。”

Although little of the research addressed the elements of a successful partnership per se, the authors discovered a wealth of information about when and why people cooperate scattered in the scientific disciplines of behavioral economics, evolutionary psychology, primatology, neuroimaging, biology, computer science (Robert Axelrod’s landmark tournaments), and traditional psychology. None of these data was sufficient alone, but when they were combined, a set of common themes presented itself.
> 尽管很少有研究直接探讨成功伙伴关系的要素，但作者在行为经济学、进化心理学、灵长类动物学、神经影像学、生物学、计算机科学（罗伯特·阿克塞尔罗德的里程碑式竞赛）以及传统心理学等科学学科中，发现了大量关于人们何时以及为何合作的信息。这些数据单独看都不充分，但当它们被综合起来时，一组共同的主题便显现出来。

In addition to the formal literature review, the investigators examined historical accounts of successful and failed partnerships, particularly those in which one partner or both left a first-person account of the collaboration. This investigation proved especially fruitful in understanding how the concepts from the various sciences play out in reallife conditions.
> 除了正式的文献综述外，研究者还审查了成功与失败伙伴关系的历史记录，尤其是那些其中一方或双方以第一人称记述合作经历的案例。这一调查在理解各种科学概念如何在现实条件中发挥作用方面尤其富有成效。

From this phase of investigation and brainstorming emerged a set of concepts and specific ideas about the difference between positive collaborative work relationships and those that were less productive. It became clear that the elements of a successful partnership were relatively consistent whether one was studying a partnership between work peers, between supervisor and employee, or between two people brought together to accomplish a goal outside of their employment.
> 从这阶段的调查和头脑风暴中，出现了一系列关于积极协作工作关系与那些成效较差关系之间差异的概念和具体想法。很明显，成功伙伴关系的要素相对一致，无论研究对象是同级同事之间的伙伴关系、主管与员工之间，还是两位为完成工作外的某个目标而结成的合作者。

2. Boss-partner studies. One of the most important issues for any workgroup is whether the manager of the team is perceived more as a boss or as a partner. Two extensive studies - one worldwide and the other in the United States — were conducted using a basic question: “Does your supervisor at work treat you more like he or she is your boss or your partner?”
> 2. 上司-伙伴研究。对于任何工作团队来说，最重要的问题之一是团队经理被看作更像是上司还是更像是伙伴。进行了两项广泛的研究——一项是全球性的，另一项在美国——使用了一个基本问题：“你在工作中的主管对待你更像是你的上司，还是更像是你的伙伴？”

In the worldwide study, more than 34,000 respondents in 108 countries were asked this
> 在全球性研究中，来自 108 个国家的超过 34,000 名受访者被问到这个

question. All respondents had indicated that they were employed and had a supervisor at work. Worldwide, 53 percent said their supervisor treated them more like he or she was a partner.
> 问题。所有受访者均表示他们在职并有一位工作主管。全球范围内，53%的人表示他们的主管对待他们更像是伙伴。

There were clear differences by region. A higher percentage of people in the Americas and in Western Europe said that their supervisor treated them more like he or she was a partner compared to those in developed Asia (Japan, Korea, etc.) and former Soviet Union countries (Russia, et al.).
> 不同地区存在明显差异。美洲和西欧地区报告其主管更像是把他们当作合作伙伴对待的人所占比例，高于已开发的亚洲（日本、韩国等）和前苏联国家（俄罗斯等）。

From this set of studies, it is clear that those who consider their manager to be more like a partner than a boss have a more positive work environment. Managers who work as partners can anticipate higher performance from their teams; high levels of engagement correspond with higher customer scores, safety, retention, creativity, productivity, and profitability for the business.
> 从这一系列研究可以清晰看出，那些把自己的经理视为伙伴而非上司的人，会拥有更积极的工作环境。以伙伴身份工作的经理可以期望其团队表现更好；高水平的投入与更高的客户评分、安全性、员工留存、创造力、生产力和企业盈利能力相对应。

3. Investigative studies. Using the hypotheses developed from the early work, a series of studies was conducted with random samples of U.S. residents using an Internet panel developed by Gallup. (More information about this panel is available below.)

b. March 2007: A sample of 100 people were asked to describe their best and worst partnerships using an open-ended question set. The respondents were asked to be as exhaustive as possible in their descriptions. A number of the anecdotes and quotes in this book come from these interviews.
> b. 2007 年 3 月：对 100 名被访者进行抽样，要求他们用开放式问题描述自己最成功和最失败的合作关系。受访者被要求在描述中尽可能详尽。本书中的许多轶事和引语来自这些访谈。

c. September 2007: A random sample of 1,072 people from the general population were asked about their most positive, successful partnerships and also about less positive and less productive partnerships. At the time of the survey, 504 of the respondents were employees who had supervisors. These respondents were asked additional questions about their supervisor relationships.
> c. 2007 年 9 月：从普通人群中随机抽取 1,072 名受访者，询问他们关于最积极、最成功的合作关系以及那些不那么积极、不太有成效的合作关系。在调查时，504 名受访者是有上司的员工，这些受访者被问及关于他们与上司关系的补充问题。

4. Test construction study. From the three phases of investigative studies listed above, a set of scales was developed that clearly differentiated between good work partnerships and poor work partnerships. Those items were built around the theoretical model established from the early informal research, the literature reviews, and the first-person accounts of successful partnerships. The items were tested in the series of investigative research studies, and the best items were placed in the Gallup Partnership Rating Scales (GPRS). This instrument was then tested

For the data presented in this report, the GPRS was administered via the Internet to 1,086 randomly selected people who were members of the Gallup Panel.
> 本报告所呈现的数据来自对盖洛普小组成员中随机抽选的 1,086 人通过互联网实施的 GPRS 调查。

The Gallup Panel was created in 2004 as a proprietary, probability-based longitudinal panel of U.S. households that have been selected using random digit dial (RDD) sampling methods. Panel households are recruited through an outbound phone interview, and they agree to participate in an average of three surveys per month via phone, Web, or mail. Once in the panel, members are not required to spend a specific predetermined amount of time as panelists. Rather, they are encouraged to remain members as long as they are willing and interested. There are no incentives or financial rewards for participating in the panel, though several token thank you gifts are sent throughout the year. Lastly, as with any longitudinal design, the Gallup Panel is affected by attrition. To leave the Gallup Panel, members can call the toll-free support phone number and request removal, or

they are removed from the panel after they fail to respond to six consecutive surveys (with a postcard prompt after the third miss). Monthly attrition rate averages between 2 and 3 percent.
> 在连续六次未回应调查后（在第 3 次未回应后会寄送明信片提示）被从小组中移除。每月流失率平均在 2%到 3%之间。

In addition to client-sponsored research, internal profile studies are conducted every three weeks with the entire adult panel population. These profile studies are designed to gather hundreds of behavioral, attitudinal, psychographic, and demographic statistics from the panelists. The data collected on these profile studies are used to target individuals for future custom research, to gain in-depth understanding of a particular industry or social issue, and to track longitudinal changes in panelist behavior and opinions.
> 除了客户资助的研究外，每三周还会对整个成年受访者小组进行一次内部画像研究。这些画像研究旨在从小组成员那里收集数百项行为、态度、心理特征和人口统计学统计数据。画像研究中收集的数据用于将个体定位为未来定制研究的对象、深入了解特定行业或社会问题，以及追踪小组成员行为和观点的纵向变化。

Each subtest in the Gallup Partnership Rating Scales has strong internal consistency (using appropriate Cronbach Alpha measures). Confirmatory factor analyses of each subtest determined that each was a single factor. The subtests are also intercorrelated.

By definition, the good partnerships were nearly all judged as successful, but even half of the poor partnerships were judged as successful in accomplishing their goals. It appears that a partnership can be seen as “successful” even if not all aspects of the relationship are clearly positive. In one-third of the poor partnerships, respondents said they accomplished more than they would have if they worked alone. Of course, the stronger partnerships were more likely to be successful than the poor partnerships. Yet even among good partnerships, 26 percent of respondents said they accomplished less working together than they would have alone. The evidence suggests that some missions do not require collaboration, and some individuals struggle to make partnerships, even strong partnerships, advantageous.
> 按定义，几乎所有优良的合作关系都被评为成功，但即便在表现不佳的合作关系中，也有一半被认为在实现目标方面是成功的。看来，即便合作关系的各个方面并非全都积极，人们仍可能将其视为“成功”。在三分之一的不良合作关系中，受访者表示他们比独自工作时取得了更多成就。当然，强有力的合作关系比不良的合作关系更有可能取得成功。然而即便在良好的合作关系中，也有 26%的受访者表示共同工作比单独工作取得的成就更少。证据表明，有些任务并不需要合作，而有些人即使在强有力的合作关系中也难以使合作带来优势。

From the results shown here, it is clear that the higher the GPRS level, the more likely the respondent is to be engaged and not actively disengaged. More than threefourths ( 76 percent) of those who were engaged in their work rated their supervisor partnership in the good or excellent range. Conversely, most ( 79 percent) of those who were actively disengaged at work rated their supervisor partnership as borderline, poor, or very poor. Having a good

Final Comments

> 结语

The Gallup Partnership Rating Scales (GPRS) is a research instrument and does not yet have the external validity or long-term use needed to be a diagnostic tool. However, through the thorough literature investigations, the investigative studies, and the creation of the Gallup Partnership Rating Scales, an interesting and actionable model emerged. Additional research using the GPRS will follow publication of this book.
> 盖洛普伙伴关系评估量表（GPRS）是一种研究工具，目前尚未具备作为诊断工具所需的外部效度或长期应用基础。然而，通过对文献的深入调查、相关研究以及盖洛普伙伴关系评估量表的创建，一个有趣且可付诸行动的模型浮现出来。在本书出版后，关于 GPRS 的进一步研究将会开展。

Much is yet to be done. For example, although correlations between workplace engagement and workplace productivity have been established, no direct correlations are yet available between strong workplace partnerships and productivity. What has been accomplished, however, is a good starting place for future research and experimentation into the important relationship between two work collaborators.
> 还有许多工作需要完成。例如，尽管已确立了职场参与度与工作绩效之间的相关性，但目前尚无强有力的职场伙伴关系与生产力之间的直接相关数据。不过，迄今为止取得的成果为未来对双人工作协作中这一重要关系的研究和实验提供了良好的起点。

This book is the result of more than the partnership between the two of us. Many collaborators brought their unique strengths to bear, and we are indebted to each of them.
> 本书的成书不仅仅归功于我们两人的合作。许多合作者贡献了他们独特的优势，我们对每一位都心怀感激。

Editor Geoff Brewer was, at turns, our advocate, critic, and counselor. He was the perfect combination of patience, insistence, and flexibility through a writing process that was unavoidably tumultuous because we were uniting many disparate sciences and stories. His observations were directly on point, and if we briefly balked at certain rewrites, cuts, and rearranging, it was only because we knew he was right. This book is as much his as it is ours.
> 编辑 Geoff Brewer 在不同阶段既是我们的拥护者，也是批评者和顾问。在这场不可避免地动荡的写作过程中，他将耐心、坚持与灵活性完美结合——因为我们要把许多不同的学科和故事汇聚到一起。他的观察切中要害，若我们对某些重写、删节或重排稍有退却，那只是因为我们知道他是对的。这本书与我们一样，也同样属于他。

Executive Publisher Larry Emond was simultaneously supportive and skeptical, both of which served the goal of getting from us the best book from our research. We muttered and grumbled along the way. Now we are grateful. Associate Publisher Dr. Piotr J. Juszkiewicz once again flawlessly managed all of the operations, from cover design to marketing and promotion to getting the presses rolling. He too gave us helpful and thoughtful editorial suggestions.
> 执行出版人 Larry Emond 在支持与怀疑之间保持平衡，这两者共同促成了我们研究成果中最好的书。一路上我们有过嘟囔和怨言。现在我们心怀感激。副出版人 Dr. Piotr J. Juszkiewicz 再次无可挑剔地管理了从封面设计到市场推广再到印刷开机的所有事务。他也给了我们有益而深思熟虑的编辑建议。

Trista Kunce was intensely vigilant with her verification of facts and sources, causing us eventually to question whether the sun in fact rises in the east. Kelly Henry brought a rare combination of insight and thoroughness on deadline to the book’s final preparations for print. Barb Sanford helped develop much of our material into compelling articles for the Gallup Management Journal. They were led by their superb manager, Kelly Slater. Chin-Yee Lai’s cover and Samantha Allemang’s interior design are wonderful icing on the cake. Alyssa Yell was a sounding board and advisor for several stylistic issues. Joy Murphy helped manage the production process for this book. Barbara Cave Henricks and Sara Schneider proved once again to be world-class publicists.
> 特里斯塔·昆斯在核查事实和来源方面极为警觉，甚至让我们最终怀疑太阳是否真的从东方升起。凯利·亨利在最后的印刷准备阶段，在截止时间内带来了罕见的洞察力和细致性。巴布·桑福德将我们许多材料整理成了引人入胜的《盖洛普管理杂志》文章。她们由出色的经理凯利·斯莱特领导。赖真怡的封面设计和萨曼莎·阿勒曼的内页设计是锦上添花。艾莉莎·耶尔在若干风格问题上充当了倾听者和顾问。乔伊·墨菲协助管理了本书的制作流程。芭芭拉·凯夫·亨里克斯和萨拉·施奈德再次证明了自己是世界级的公关人员。

Rachel Brown and Heather Totin tracked down much of the secondary research, some of it tucked in quite obscure corners. They were both incredible detectives over many months. Paula Wilhelm’s air traffic control work during the culminating months was instrumental in getting it off to the presses, as was the ongoing typing and coordinating efforts of Linda Bjorkman and Rachel Penrod.
> 瑞秋·布朗和希瑟·托廷查找了大量次级研究资料，其中一些藏在相当隐蔽的角落。几个月来她们两人都像不可思议的侦探。保拉·威廉姆在最后几个月里像空中交通管制一样的工作对将其送入印刷发挥了关键作用，琳达·比约克曼和瑞秋·潘罗德持续的打字与协调工作也同样重要。

When, after repeated attempts, we could not get so much as a simple reply from the Game Show Network, University of Chicago Economics Professor John A. List was kind enough to loan us the tapes of Friend or Foe? he used for his research. We consider Dr. List a friend. The Game Show Network is our foe (but we are working on forgiving them).
> 在多次尝试之后，我们连来自游戏频道（Game Show Network）的一句简单回复都没能收到，芝加哥大学经济学教授约翰·A·利斯特（John A. List）好心把他用于研究的《Friend or Foe?》节目录像借给了我们。我们认为利斯特博士是我们的朋友。游戏频道是我们的敌人（但我们正在努力学会原谅他们）。

Salt Lake Tribune sports reporters Michael C. Lewis and Phil Miller provided crucial insights into the partnership between Utah Jazz players John Stockton and Karl Malone. Margot Morrell, coauthor of Shackleton’s Way, was very willing to share notes and observations from her original research on the relationship between Ernest Shackleton and Frank Wild. Steve Ruedisili gave us a first-edition copy of Tenzing Norgay’s autobiography, Tiger of the Snows, which led us to include the quintessential partnership of Tenzing and Edmund Hillary.
> 《盐湖论坛报》（Salt Lake Tribune）体育记者迈克尔·C·刘易斯（Michael C. Lewis）和菲尔·米勒（Phil Miller）为我们提供了关于犹他爵士队球员约翰·斯托克顿（John Stockton）与卡尔·马龙（Karl Malone）之间伙伴关系的关键见解。《沙克尔顿之道》（Shackleton’s Way）合著者玛戈·莫雷尔（Margot Morrell）非常乐意分享她关于欧内斯特·沙克尔顿（Ernest Shackleton）与弗兰克·怀尔德（Frank Wild）关系的原始研究笔记和观察记录。史蒂夫·鲁迪西利（Steve Ruedisili）赠予我们丹增·诺尔盖（Tenzing Norgay）自传《雪山之虎》（Tiger of the Snows）的一版初版书，这促使我们把丹增与埃德蒙·希拉里（Edmund Hillary）这对典型伙伴关系纳入其中。

Battalion Chief Charles Hermann of the Rochester, Minnesota, Fire Department - Rodd’s best friend in the seventh grade - checked his memory and the chemistry of the oxygen-acetylene balloon incident from their shared days in junior high shop class. During a November 2007 flight delay, Northwest Airlines Captain Mark Schwinge invited passengers to visit the flight deck. Beating out a line of 5-year-olds and their mothers, Rodd was invited to sit in the first officer’s seat by Captain Schwinge, who agreed to an impromptu interview and subsequently sent a page of eloquent thoughts on collaboration in the cockpit.

> 谨以此文纪念唐纳德·O·克利夫顿博士，他是许多人心中终极的伙伴，他的思想是我们理论框架的核心。

Many of the ideas for the book were inspired by Gale’s experiences over many years as a partner and manager. We would be remiss in not mentioning some of those key work partnerships. Early in his career, successful partnerships included those with Gene Carroll, Mercedes Crawford, Alfredo Gamez, Luis Guzman, Larry Johnson, Connie Rath, Vic Resendez, Ted Rethmeier, and Mike Wortman. At Gallup, in addition to those already mentioned above, some of the most successful partnerships included those with Scott Ahlstrand, Dave Bauer, Dr. Cheryl Beamer, Jeff Bechtolt, Patrick Bogart, Richard Burkholder, Hess Dyas, Sherry Erhlich, Neli Esipova, Johanna Godoy, Agnes Illyes, Chris McCarty, Jan Miller, JoAnn Miller, Lymari Morales, Matt Mosser, Dr. Frank Newport, Nicole Naurath, Dr. Susan Nugent, Steve O’Brien, Dr. Anita Pugliese, Julie Ray, Jesus Rios, Phil Ruhlman, CK Sharma, Linda Slovic, Dr. Rajesh Srinivasan, Annette Templeton, Dr. Bob Tortora, Dr. Mary Trouba, John Wood, and Dr. Tao Wu.
> 本书的许多构想来自盖尔多年作为合伙人和经理的经历。我们如果不提及其中一些关键的工作伙伴关系便不妥。在他职业生涯早期，成功的伙伴关系包括与 Gene Carroll、Mercedes Crawford、Alfredo Gamez、Luis Guzman、Larry Johnson、Connie Rath、Vic Resendez、Ted Rethmeier 和 Mike Wortman 的合作。在盖洛普，除了上面已提到的人之外，一些最成功的伙伴关系还包括与 Scott Ahlstrand、Dave Bauer、Dr. Cheryl Beamer、Jeff Bechtolt、Patrick Bogart、Richard Burkholder、Hess Dyas、Sherry Erhlich、Neli Esipova、Johanna Godoy、Agnes Illyes、Chris McCarty、Jan Miller、JoAnn Miller、Lymari Morales、Matt Mosser、Dr. Frank Newport、Nicole Naurath、Dr. Susan Nugent、Steve O’Brien、Dr. Anita Pugliese、Julie Ray、Jesus Rios、Phil Ruhlman、CK Sharma、Linda Slovic、Dr. Rajesh Srinivasan、Annette Templeton、Dr. Bob Tortora、Dr. Mary Trouba、John Wood 和 Dr. Tao Wu 的合作。

Some of the best models of great partnership are Gallup’s top executives: Jim Krieger, CFO; Jane Miller, COO; and Jim Clifton, Chairman and CEO. For Gale, each has been a best friend at work and a work partner who made life better and made work fun and highly productive.
> 盖洛普的高管是出色合作关系的最好范例之一：首席财务官吉姆·克里格、首席运营官简·米勒以及董事长兼首席执行官吉姆·克利夫顿。对盖尔来说，他们每个人既是职场上的挚友，也是让生活更美好、让工作更有趣且高效的工作伙伴。

This book was substantially influenced by the example of Dr. John Dykes, fellow scoutmaster with Rodd of Boy Scout Troop 3295, Northern Star Council, during much of the writing. Scoutmaster Dykes epitomized each of the eight elements of partnership under the pressure of ensuring the safety and progress of a dozen scouts through ax handling, fire building, sudden thunderstorms, and the coordinated attack on camp of a small army of raccoons.
> 在本书写作的大部分时间里，约翰·戴克斯博士的榜样对本书影响甚大；他与罗德是童子军第 3295 队（北星委员会）的并肩童子军队长。戴克斯队长在确保十几名童子军在使用斧头、生火、突遇雷雨以及抵御一小群浣熊“围攻”营地等压力情形下，完美体现了合作关系的八大要素。

Gale is especially appreciative of the lifelong influence of his family. His brothers, Gary, Denny, and Dean, and his sister, Kathy, and their spouses and families have been a great source of strength. Gale’s parents were a model partnership in life and in business, and early in life, his Aunt Shirley always treated him as an “equal adult.” A special thank you goes to Gale’s good friend and son, Ed, and Ed’s wonderful wife, Leigh Ann, and their very special children, Atticus, Helena, Henson, and Dasha. Thank you to his daughter, Kelly, who always brings joy into lives and to her life partner, Josh, who has been her perfect complement. And, most of all, Gale thanks Kay for being his perfect partner and for making him a whole person.
> 盖尔尤其感激家人对他一生的影响。他的兄弟加里、丹尼和迪恩，以及妹妹凯西，和他们的配偶与家庭一直是他巨大的力量源泉。盖尔的父母在生活和事业中都是典范的伙伴关系，而在他早年，姨妈雪莉总是把他当作“平等的成年人”来看待。特别感谢盖尔的好友兼儿子艾德，以及艾德那位出色的妻子莉安和他们非常特别的孩子们：阿提克斯、海伦娜、亨森和达莎。感谢他的女儿凯莉，总是为生活带来欢乐，也感谢她的生活伴侣乔什，他一直是她的完美互补。最重要的是，盖尔要感谢凯伊，感谢她成为他完美的伙伴，让他成为一个完整的人。

Thank you, Charlie, for cheering me on through several of the toughest rewriting days. And thank you, Nora, for a thousand gentle course corrections. Power of 2 could not have been written without their understanding and support.
> 书尚未完成。Noelle，谢谢你热情地阅读手稿，这大大鼓舞了我。Parks，谢谢你成为一个完全值得信赖的攀岩和潜水伙伴。Charlie，感谢你在我几次最艰难的重写日里为我加油。Nora，感谢你千百次温柔的纠偏。没有他们的理解与支持，《力量的二人行》不可能完成。

As coauthors of a book about partnership, we endeavored to follow our own advice. We think we did fairly well. We certainly had a great time making these discoveries together, and we accomplished something neither of us could have done by himself. We got a nice souvenir of our collaboration. It is deeply rewarding to know that long after we both have passed away, somewhere on some bookshelf we will be known as partners.
> 作为一本关于伙伴关系的合著者，我们努力遵循自己的建议。我们认为自己做得相当不错。我们在共同发现这些内容时确实非常享受，也完成了任何一人单独都无法完成的事情。我们得到了合作的美好纪念。深知即便我们俩都已离世，在某个书架上的某处仍会以搭档身份被人记住，这让人感到十分欣慰。

In Power of 2, Gallup experts Rodd Wagner and Gale Muller give insight and advice on the eight elements that make or break a partnership. Along the way, they address some of the most intriguing issues raised by their discoveries:
> 在《Power of 2》中，盖洛普专家罗德·瓦格纳和盖尔·穆勒对决定合作成败的八大要素提供了洞见和建议。在此过程中，他们讨论了其发现所提出的一些最引人入胜的问题：

COMPLEMENTARY STRENGTHS: Your strengths are stronger, and your weaknesses weaker, than you realize.
> 互补的优势：你的优势比你意识到的更强，你的弱点则比你想象的更弱。

A COMMON MISSION: Why the foundation of any collaboration is too often assumed and neglected.
> 共同的使命：为什么任何合作的基础常常被视为理所当然并被忽视。

FAIRNESS: Why the adults you work with still need the playground rules they learned as children.
> 公平：为什么与你共事的成年人仍然需要他们小时候在操场上学到的规则。

TRUST: If you want people to trust you, you need to start trusting them.
> 信任：如果你希望别人信任你，你需要先开始信任他们。

ACCEPTANCE: Why you are no more likely to find a perfect collaborator than to be one.
> 接纳：你不太可能找到一个完美的合作者，也不太可能自己就是一个完美的合作者。

FORGIVENESS: How to find the upside in a breach of your trust.

COMMUNICATING: Why the quality of your partnership cannot exceed the quality of your communication.

Humans are made for collaborating. But in today’s do-it-yourself world, we spend too much of our time working alone. The principles in Power of 2 will allow you to recapture the partnerships we lost along the way.
